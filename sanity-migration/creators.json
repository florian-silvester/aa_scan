    "biography": "Are there events that combine art and craftsmanship, form and function and that inspire a broad audience without elitist barriers? Yes, there are, even if the term “art” does not come to the fore. Such events are modestly referred to as ceramics days, ceramics markets or, as in Diessen am Ammersee, pottery market. The show will open with an early morning steamboat ride on Ascension Day, May 29th. Around 160 ceramists from twelve countries will present their works over the weekend. But there is much more to this festival of contemporary ceramics. The Diessen pottery market in the lakeside park on Lake Ammersee in Upper Bavaria. © Noah Cohen. The market’s director Wolfgang Lösche has been organizing the international show in the lakeside park for the past 25 years. The range of ceramic diversity extends from household ceramics for the home and garden to remarkable works of art. As one of the largest such markets in Europe, the Diessen Pottery Market is highly esteemed in the contemporary ceramics scene and annually attracts up to 60,000 visitors, including collectors and representatives of museums. The high quality of the exhibited objects and the special atmosphere at the show have become the event’s trademark. Exhibitors not only come to sell: Diessen is also a popular meeting place for sharing among professionals. An important element is the competition for the Diessen Ceramics Prize, which the kiln manufacturer Rohde endows with 5,000 euros. This year’s theme is “Color Play.” The works can be seen in the historic Traidtcasten next to the Marienmünster. The Young Ceramics Prize sets a new accent. The international competition is sponsored by the ceramics supply company Wolfbring. The works of the participants will be presented at the Kulturforum Blaues Haus. The traditional Keramikweg invites visitors to stroll through the idyllic market town and visit some of the workshops. A detour to the Taubenturm is always worthwhile, where the sculptures of the award-winning ",

    "biography": "The theme of Eva Maisch‘s summer exhibition this year sounds almost universal. After all, shapes and colors comprise the physical existence of nearly all works of art and craftsmanship. Nevertheless, the works by the five artists presented in the Franconian municipality of Lindelbach in 2025 are very special and, in each case, unique. The blacksmithing of Antje Dienstbir, for example is a good example. For 25 years, she has devoted herself to the spoon, exploring its function as a piece of cutlery or kitchen utensil in a cross-cultural and inventive way, and has created matching ceramic vessels. In her patient pursuit of innovative refinement, she has expanded her spoon theme in recent years to include vessels made of copper and silver – breathtakingly fine, also colored, and always perfect. Masterful smithing reminiscent of Japanese tea ceramics by Antje Dienstbir. © Antje Dienstbir. For decades, Ann van Hoey has cut and folded smooth clay to create shapes, some of which are strikingly colorful. For a long time, the natural hue of the clay determined the character of the form. Later, the Belgian ceramicist embellished stoneware bowls with a coating of vividly colored car paint. Now she is exploring how she can achieve lush colors using ceramic techniques alone. Clear shapes and strong colors, ceramic art by Ann van Hoey, © Ann van Hoey. Christoph Leuner understands his enigmatic hollow bodies “as containers for storing personal items and thoughts of significance.” For many years, this trained carpenter, wood sculptor and teacher has explored exciting forms made of wood and wood-based materials that can appropriately contain their contents, which are also intended to be poetic.

    "biography": "Jewelry designers from all over the world, along with their gallery owners, collectors and fans, gather in Munich every year in mid-March. Well over 100 exhibitions have been organized for many years. Of central importance is the special Schmuck (Jewelry) exhibition, which was renamed SCHMUCKmünchen in 2025. The show at the International Craft Fair features works by approximately 60 jewelry makers with artistic aspirations – around 800 artists from all over the world applied this time. Schmuck, the first special jewelry exhibition, was initiated by Herbert Hofmann from the Chamber of Crafts of Munich and Upper Bavaria in 1959. After more than 60 years, it is clear that artistic jewelry, also known as art jewelry, has become institutionalized and spread worldwide. But what does the future hold for jewelry art? And what do leading artists think about their perspectives? The international festival of art jewelry in Munich provided a good opportunity to talk to some renowned protagonists about this.

Ceramic art is another genre that has freed itself from traditional constraints since the second half of the 20th century. Here, too, exhibitions of high artistic quality are staged worldwide. Prestigious competitions and excellent galleries exist, but unfortunately only in small numbers. As in jewelry art, the players have shared ideas internationally, learned from one another and grown into a large community. Here, too, the understanding of ceramics with intellectual content and messages is only gradually seeping into the collective art consciousness. Our cover story presents the work of Zizipho Poswa.

    "biography": "Every year during the Handwerksmesse and Munich Jewellery Week, the Pinakothek der Moderne presents the work of a renowned international jewelry artist: This year, the work of Warwick Freeman can be seen in the rotunda. Born in Nelson, New Zealand, in 1953, he has spent five decades creating a lexicon of the symbols that surround us – from the cultural symbolism of the hook and the star to the heart, made from the slag of the volcanic island of Rangitoto off the coast of Auckland. His works tell a very empathetic story of the culture and history of his country, called Aotearoa in the Māori language. “When you wear a piece of Warwick Freeman jewelry, it conveys something of who you are as a New Zealander and how you have lived,” one says in New Zealand. Against this background, Freeman has never tired of searching for the right answers for contemporary jewelry. Warwick Freeman, Brooches White Ghost, Orange Ghost, Green Ghost, 2003. Corian, steel. Courtesy of Die Neue Sammlung – The Design Museum, photo Die Neue Sammlung (Alexander Laurenzo). Even as a Pākehā, as the indigenous Māori of New Zealand call those with European roots, Freeman&#8217;s work reflects a deep consideration of the construction of identity in a country that calls the culture of the Māori, Polynesia and the European settlers its own. He finds his forms as &#8216;waste&#8217; of the daily living space, as remnants of colonization as in the rich geology of the country. They provide him with a rich source of materials such as the millimeter-thick mother-of-pearl of the giant clam, the iridescent inner skin of the paua, a rainbow abalone, or the pounamu, a greenstone, and stories from which he can draw. “Hook Hand Heart Star” – the four nouns that make up the title of the exhibition in Munich are inspired by Freeman&#8217;s first compilation of such emblematic works from 1987: “Fern Fish Feather Rose”, which is now in the Sarjeant Gallery “Te Whare o Rehua Whanganui”.

Even more important is a growing open-mindedness and acceptance among the disciplines. Although the barriers that have grown historically – for example between fine arts and crafts – have not disappeared, they are more permeable than ever. The fact that this is happening simultaneously in many countries and cultures is a ray of hope in the political turmoil of our time. At the Mayer’sche Hofkunstanstalt in Munich, artists and craftspeople from many countries design and produce stained glass and mosaics, both historical and contemporary, for churches, modern buildings, and private and public spaces.

Although the word “spirituality” does not appear in Jörg Johnen’s article about Anita Oettershagen and her works, the way this artist refers to nature in her textile sculptures and drawings can be described as spiritual. After being a professor of design theory and textile design at the Niederrhein University of Applied Sciences from 1983 to 2010, Anita Oettershagen devoted more of her time to her own artistic work. Jewelry is particularly associated with spirituality. Along with the earliest cave drawings and tools, adornment stands at the very beginning of human culture. It is worth remembering that jewelry’s renewal after 1945 was initiated, among others, by the so-called School of Padua.

    "biography": "The “aufgetischt” (“laid table”) exhibition at the Kunst- und Gewerbeverein in Regensburg is not about traditionally set tables. Rather, it is about objects that “break ranks” and occupy a space between craftsmanship, design, applied arts and the fine arts. In addition to works by Regensburg-based artists Renate Höning, Christine Weissenseel, Ludwig Hirtreiter and Susanne Holzinger, works made of metal, ceramic, glass and textile can be seen. Their creators from Germany and Italy have mostly studied at technical colleges and universities for art and design. Above all, however, they renew the forms and contents of traditional crafts such as gold- and silversmithing, pottery, glassmaking and weaving, so that their creations can often stand on a par with sophisticated works of fine art. Silver spoons by Gabi Veit. On display in the exhibition “aufgetischt” (dished up) by the Kunst- und Gewerbeverein Regensburg e.V. (Regensburg Art and Trade Association). Photo Paul Dittmann. There are, for example, imaginative spoons by Gabi Veit from Bolzano, whose diverse “creatures” encounter artfully forged bowls made of thin copper foil by Passau-born Bettina Dittlmann, dancing silver cups by Juliane Schölss from Nuremberg and copper cups by Antje Dienstbir from Wiesbaden. Anne Fischer from Nuremberg and Sarah Cossham from Munich bring unusual “silverware” to the table, while peppermills by Isabelle Enders from Nuremberg combine function and an abundance of forms. An entertaining potpourri of ceramics and glass awaits visitors. The items include sculptural lattice vases by Ute Kathrin Beck from Stuttgart; glass vessels by Dagmar Gerke from Hildesheim, which were inspired by their creator’s trip to Taiwan; amorphous ceramic bowls by Dietlind Wolf from Lübeck; and ceramics by Maya Fenderl from Halle (Saale), which combine and contrast geometric and organic elements.

From October 25 to 27, 2024, around 140 exhibitors from 13 countries will present handmade unique pieces and small series in the fields of jewelry, ceramics, glass, wood, metal, textiles, fashion and paper. This year, the focus is particularly on works from Italy and the Netherlands, but contributions from China, Korea and the USA also enrich the fair. There is a special focus on jewelry and ceramics. Thanks to the smow design prize, which was only launched in 2023, the number of submissions in the field of interior design has increased, with many young talents presenting their works for the first time. The exhibition boths are spread throughout the GRASSI Museum of Applied Arts. Exhibitors can be found in the foyers, the Art Deco Pfeilerhalle and in the permanent exhibition Antiquity to Historicism. This unique combination of historical and contemporary art creates exciting dialogues between tradition and modernity. Some of the exhibitors at the Grassimesse show their work in the permanent exhibition Antiquity to Historicism. Above, works by the ceramist Lutz Könecke, Großenrode, last year. Also on display in the permanent exhibition during the Grassimesse are the works of Elke Sada from Leipzig. The Grassimesse is a meeting place for creatives, gallery owners, collectors and friends of applied art from all over Europe.

    "biography": "For the 2024 exhibition of the Forum for Applied Arts at the Neues Museum in Nuremberg, the five members Paul Müller, Cornelius Réer, Sabine Steinhäusler, Annette Zey and Sabine Ziegler have invited five female artists as “elective relatives.” The focus is on “related” forms and content as well as ways of working and thinking. The metal designer Paul Müller chose the Berlin-based jewelry artist Svenja John. Both artists place importance on the playful use of geometric forms and the exploration of the sculptural possibilities of an idea without losing sight of its function. Although Müller and John are familiar with traditional artisanal techniques, they have no reservations about utilizing industrial production methods. Müller works with steel, stainless steel, bronze, brass and silver for his clear sculptural forms, while Svenja John uses colored elements made of polycarbonate and nylon, has them cut using modern production techniques and combines them to create ornamental structures. Forum members Angewandte Kunst Nürnberg have invited participants with “related” positions to the exhibition in the Neues Museum.

The goldsmith Sabine Ziegler chose the Munich-based ceramist Christine Wagner as her “elective relative.” Both love clear forms and delicate surfaces. Christine Wagner’s stoneware vessels and vases are based on the basic geometric shapes of cylinders, cubes and cuboids; lines, grids and stamped impressions contrast with the architectural severity of the exterior forms. Sabine Ziegler saws and files the shapes of her rings from special wax. The resulting structures are further processed after casting.

His spectacular portraits are composed like collages of vegetables, grain, fruit, fish, books or baskets. Archimboldo’s eccentric and humorous artworks were highly valued at aristocratic courts and were welcome additions to art collections and cabinets of curiosities. Afterwards collage disappeared from view for centuries, until Dadaists and Surrealists breathed new life into the genre. Since then, collage has developed into an artistic genre in its own right. Bowl, shell green with emerald green glass base, 2018, H 12 cm, W 43 cm. Photo def image. Born in Rotterdam in 1965, Wietske van Leeuwen has devoted herself to naturalistic assemblages in her ceramics for over thirty years. In 1993, she completed her ceramic studies at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam, which was directed by Jan van der Vaart (1931-2000). Personal style and technical perfection were still in demand at that time, but craftsmanship has completely disappeared from the curriculum today. The Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam acquired works by Wietske van Leeuwen very early on. The Amsterdam-based gallery owner Carla Koch (1949-2022) represented her until the gallerist’s death. As a child, Wietske van Leeuwen was fascinated by her grandfather’s collection of seashells. She inherited her love of plants from her father, who transformed the spacious grounds of her parental home into an Edenic paradise. This ceramicist likes to use seashells “because they are fan-shaped and fit together symmetrically.” The same applies to tapered snail shells, which reveal the natural process of organic growth.

Legendary artist duels have been known since the Renaissance, for example, between Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. The institutionalization of competition in art began in 1667 with the Salon de Paris of the Sun King Louis XIV, who propagated courtly tastes in art. In 1863, French Impressionists organized the first Salon des Refusés, the Salon of the Rejected, which is considered the beginning of Modernism. Curated exhibitions at museums and galleries, as well as competitions in which juries make decisions, are now widespread around the globe. The invention of the internet accelerated the processes. The Loewe Foundation Craft Prize is a competition that has set new standards for the arts and crafts. Top quality is guaranteed by prize money of 50,000 euros, a worldwide call for entries, a first-class pre-selection panel, an expert jury and impeccable organization. In addition, the prize brings about a developmental process that changes the world’s perception of craftsmanship.

Claus Bury was born into a family of jewelers in Hanau in 1946 and seemed predestined to take over his parents’ business. But after studying at the Hanau Drawing Academy and the Pforzheim Art and Crafts School, he preferred to become a jewelry artist. Between the 1960s and 1980s, the goal of renewing the convention-bound goldsmith’s craft with new forms and intellectual contents took precedence over any competition. In 1979, Bury decided to work only as a sculptor. Julie Metzdorf visited Claus Bury ",

    "biography": "Artifacts unearthed at archeological excavations prove that the Lindelbach district near Würzburg was already inhabited in the New Stone Age. The so-called “Neolithic revolution” around 7,000 years ago marked the beginning of farming, which is documented by the Linear Pottery culture. Evidence of early craftsmanship from the Bronze and Iron Ages has also been found near the village of Lindelbach, which was incorporated into the Franconian wine-growing town of Randersacker in 1975. From July 5 to 7, 2024, Lindelbach will once again host an exhibition of applied art. The show’s atmospheric setting is provided by a former farmhouse owned by Eva Maisch and her husband Walter Jäckl in the village’s center. At the first summer festival in 2018, well-established artists impressed visitors with contemporary jewelry and art objects crafted from a wide variety of materials. The “Inspiration and Curiosity” exhibit has never been so international.

Works by last year&#8217;s jewelry award winner Stefanie Prießnitz will now be shown in a solo exhibition at the Deutsches Goldschmiedehaus Hanau from March 12 to April 4, 2024. The jewelry artist, who works in Pforzheim, impressed the jury – Susanne Högner, Daniel Ramos and Dr. Christianne Weber-Stöber – with her versatile interpretations of the classic pearl necklace and the unusual combination of pearl and metal. Stefanie Prießnitz&#8216;s jewelry work is characterized by conceptual series. Within her collections, the repetition of forms, techniques and materials in different combinations constantly creates new variations. Stefanie Prießnitz&#8217;s Perlreihen [Pearl Series] are contemporary pearl necklaces. By combining pearls with white or blackened silver elements, she creates open spaces that break up the compact image. The necklaces in the Aufgereiht [Lined up] collection consist of round-cut gemstones, which are threaded into a silver construction to form a larger decorative element and also form the course of the necklace. Photo Peter Hölzle.The silver structures of the Aufgereiht [Lined up] series are not filled with stone beads for the Umwickelt necklace, but are wrapped in textile threads. The resulting ornaments are reminiscent of stars. Photo Peter Hölzle.The Perlseidenketten [Pearl Silk Necklaces] grew out of a preoccupation with textiles. Here the beads are spun around a soft thread to line them up. The impression is determined by the regularity of the thread. © Stefanie Prießnitz Stefanie Prießnitz trained as a goldsmith at the Pforzheim Goldsmith School from 1991 to 1995. She went on to study at the Hochschule für Gestaltung, Pforzheim, and Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, USA, until 2000, where she expanded her creative repertoire.

In 2021, it was opened up to all professional ceramists, regardless of their participation in the ceramics market. The prize was awarded for the fifth time on February 4, 2024 at the Siegburg City Museum. Alix Brodeur, Höhr-Grenzhausen, is the winner of the 5th Siegburg Ceramics Prize with her installation Standort. A jury of experts chose the prize winners and a total of 59 participants for the exhibition from a field of 113 applications from 23 nations. The first prize went to US-born Alix Brodeur from Höhr-Grenzhausen for her expansive installation Standort. Second prize was awarded to Christiane Wilhelm from Munich for her vessel Mother of Pearls. Third prize was conferred on Christa Zeitlhofer from Vienna for an artwork titled deformed circle on ellipsoid with bicycle, 2022. A special prize was awarded to Ulrike Uschmann from Osnabrück. Commendations went to Michela Benedan from Halle, Nathalie Cohn from Copenhagen, Monika Debus from Höhr-Grenzhausen and Maria Pohlkemper from Billerbeck.

For the first time, the award did not have a specific theme, but was dedicated simply to “current trends in ceramics.” With the international opening of the ceramics market and the associated prize, the Stadtmuseum Siegburg has expanded its collection concept to include contemporary ceramics. The focus is on works by ceramists who have a connection to the town with its long pottery tradition, as well as to the ceramics market, to the prize or to exhibitions in the town museum.

This raises the question of what designers can do to make a meaningful and effective contribution toward its preservation. Our cover story presents a prime example. Anna Heringer studied architecture at the University of Art and Industrial Design in Linz. After working for an aid organization in Bangladesh, she felt the need to combine design with social and ecological responsibility. This architect found an answer in building with clay, which is not only healthy and environmentally friendly, but also very beautiful. “Beauty is when something is harmonious – harmonious towards the planet and the environment and also in the interests of future generations.” It is important to internalize this sentence – for designers and for all of us, if we want to preserve our planet.

Artists, designers, workshops and studios, as well as students and graduates, have until May 15 to submit applications for participation in this international sales fair for applied art and design. An international jury of experts selects the participants for the Grassimesse. Artistic quality in the design and execution is the decisive criterion. With a tradition dating back to 1920, the Grassimesse is one of the most important international sales fairs for applied art and design. The three-day event enables experts, as well as visitors who are interested in good design, to learn about current developments in the applied arts. Design projects from international universities are presented and current works by internationally renowned artists and designers, as well as newcomers to the scene, are available for purchase. Unique pieces and small series from the fields of jewelry, ceramics, glass, furniture, metal, stone, textiles, fashion, paper, toys and accessories will be on offer. A total of seven Grassi Prizes, endowed with a total of €11,000, will be awarded during the Grassimesse. Application forms and further information on the Grassimesse are now available at Bewerbung | Grassimesse Metamorphoses: Photographs by Herlinde Koelbl A visit to the Grassimuseum is also worthwhile throughout the year. In addition to viewing the richly stocked rooms of the permanent collection, aficionados of art and design can look forward to exciting special exhibitions. Current shows include magnificent nature photographs by Herlinde Koelbl and Art Nouveau objects. Born in 1939, Herlinde Koelbl ranks among the great contemporary German photo artists.

    "biography": "Everyone knows that museums are places where objects are exhibited, researched and preserved for the enjoyment and cultural education of current and future generations. As a result, these objects, especially art objects and one-of-a-kind items, are off limits for private acquisitors. An exception is made at in-house fairs staged by museums of crafts and applied arts, where visitors can not only look at or study the displayed items, but also touch or even caress and always purchase them. The package also includes face-to-face meetings with the objects’ creators. Such encounters are hardly possible anymore in an economy based on the division of labor. This unusual format is traditionally offered in Germany for the entire spectrum of arts and crafts at the Grassimesse Leipzig (late October) and the MK&amp;G messe Hamburg (late November). The management of the fair in Hamburg explains: “This tradition creates and supports the long-term relationships between collectors and artists that are crucial to today’s craft practice.” Both fairs are of considerable non-material and economic value to the select group of designers chosen by the expert jurors.

Fifty-four German and international participants, including four collectives, were selected to present their work at the MK&amp;G messe. In addition, five “Young Talents” will be sponsored for the second time. The quintet can exhibit at the fair and on the premises of MKG Hamburg without paying booth fees.

    "biography": "The GRASSI Museum in Leipzig combines a museum of applied arts with a museum of ethnology and a museum of musical instruments. Stimulating historical collections, current exhibitions and popular events such as the annual Grassifest in September combine to make the internationally renowned GRASSI Museum an important pillar of cultural life Leipzig. But the GRASSI, which was built between 1925 and 1929 as one of the few large museum buildings in the Weimar Republic, has even more to offer. The Grassimesse, which is held annually at the end of October, is an exemplary event for contemporary arts and crafts in Germany and beyond. This fair for designers and their audiences is a highlight of the year for many participants and actively contributes toward assuring a bright future for all genres of the applied arts. Furthermore, participation in the juried sales exhibition always was and still remains tantamount to a seal of quality. Sonja Ekmann, Lund, Sweden, brooches.

    "biography": "The Danner Prize, one of the most important awards in this field, was awarded for the fourteenth time in 2023. The competition promotes new design ideas and developments in the field of crafts. A jury of experts awards the Danner Prize, which is endowed with 15,000 euros. Four honorary prize winners each receive 4,000 euros. Gunther Pfeffer, master carpenter, designer and detail enthusiast, received the Danner Prize for this filigree showcase cabinet. Photo Eva Jünger. Gunther Pfeffer won the Danner Prize 2023 for his showcase cabinet “Raster.” The delicate exterior of the cabinet is made from a grid of fir slats and alternates between transparent and closed, depending on the angle of view, thus inviting its viewers to actively engage with the object and to seek what lies behind it. Honorary prizes were awarded to Christiane Englsberger for her headdress “Fülle” made of rye straw, to Beate Leonard for her vase made of tombac, to Nico Schipp for his ceramic installation “Lined up” and to Christoph Straube for his enamel brooches, which create an illusion of three-dimensionality. This year’s exhibition of the Danner Foundation takes place in cooperation with the museums of the city of Landshut. For the presentation in the light-flooded Heiliggeistkirche, the following artists were selected in addition to the award winners: Otto Baier, Ute Kathrin Beck, Nicole Beck, Veronika Beckh, Roswitha Berger-Gentsch, Brigitte Bezold, Alexander Blank, Sarah Cossham, Susanne Elstner, Christian B.

    "biography": "An artist’s life work is often synonymous with their entire oeuvre. It includes all the works produced in the course of a lifetime, whether they be paintings, sculptures, films, texts, jewelry, music, etc. An artist’s life work usually also includes several other areas of human endeavor, which ideally combine to produce a unified whole of which the creator can be proud at the end of their life and which subsequent generations can look back upon with appreciation and gratitude. This also holds true for the life work of art collectors, which is seldom limited solely to the acquired artworks. Collecting is typically a secondary activity that is linked to other fields of endeavor. For example, Laura Borghi’s collection of antique and contemporary ceramics is associated with her career as a gallerist and with her workshop, where she produces works for artists and designers and where workshops are taught. There is currently a call for entries for the Officine Saffi Award, which biennially draws the public’s attention to ceramic art. Laura Borghi not only opened the doors of her gallery and workshop to Katharina Perlongo, but also opened her stylish apartment in Milan. Two ceramics by Picasso in the kitchen: Paolo Riolzi photographed the apartment of the gallery owner, collector and patron Laura Borghi for Art Aurea. The life’s work of Marion Delarue is still in the making. Although this French jewelry artist is only 36 years old, clear contours have long been discernible. These include unabashed play with the disconcerting intersections between nature and artificiality and between authenticity and imitation, as well as grappling with the concepts of fake, imitation and counterfeit. The results are distinguished by perfect craftsmanship and consummate aesthetics, even if some pets have to surrender a few feathers in the process. An article by Julie Metzdorf.

    "biography": "The ceramic artworks by Margareta Daepp, who was born in Bern in 1959, that are on display at the Musée Ariana may seem at first glance like examples of reduced, functional product design. But in reality, many of these pieces pose questions, for example, about form as a bearer of meaning, memory or aesthetic norms. In addition, this Swiss artist’s frequently monochrome creations combine Near Eastern and Far Eastern concepts with minimalist Western ideas. “Her artistic universe is characterized by silence, austerity, poetry, color, emptiness and space.” The statement from the museum in Geneva adds that her works are of impressive clarity, lively, yet simultaneously also serene and calm, the result of an enlightened and uncompromising artistic path.

Photo Dominique Uldry. Anne-Claire Schumacher, chief curator at the Musée Ariana, explains that while attending the preliminary course (1976-77) at the School of Design in Bern, Margareta Daepp quickly realized “that the third dimension is crucial for her.” This is why she chose the ceramics class over the graphics class. Margareta Daepp’s artistic interest was sparked by Philippe Lambercy (1919-2006), who headed the ceramics department at the Ecole des Arts Décoratifs de Genève and was instrumental in overcoming traditional artisanal and industrial boundaries in ceramics. After receiving her diploma in Bern in 1981, she enrolled at the Ecole des Arts Décoratifs in Geneva, where she met the Japanese ceramic artist Setsuko Nagasawa, which was born in Kyoto in 1941. Schumacher writes: “Everything is different here: the working of the clay, the view of the material and the handling of the proportions. The young artist is fascinated by Nagasawa’s direct and frontal confrontation with the material, as well as her thoughtful and precise manual ",

The jury selected 116 works from a field of 312 submissions. A prize jury then chose the winners of the state prizes in six categories. The nominated works will be on display from May 27 to August 13, 2023 in a special exhibition at the MAKK – Museum für Angewandte Kunst Köln (Cologne Museum of Applied Arts), where each visitor will also have the opportunity to choose their favorite piece and cast a ballot for the audience prize. With a total of 60,000 euros, Manufactum is one of the most important prizes of its kind in Germany. The competition and exhibit were organized on behalf of the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia by the Beratungsstelle für Formgebung der Handwerkskammer Aachen, Gut Rosenberg.

    "biography": "Much of what the modern world has brought us is simultaneously a blessing and a curse. This also applies to plastics. Major developments in science, technology and the economy would have been impossible without the technical properties of plastics, which include malleability, strength and cheap processing. But the dangers associated with plastics were unfortunately ignored. Used carelessly and thoughtlessly, plastic wastes pollute our soil, float in rivers and oceans in terrifyingly huge quantities, and destroy life – animal life and, ultimately probably also human life. Since the 1960s, many artists have also succumbed to the allure of plastics. For example, Niki de Saint Phalle relied on plastics in the design of her colorful Nanas. And Peter Chang used plastics in jewelry art, although he melted down previously used plastic for his expressive bracelets, thus giving a second life to the synthetic material. Chang, who died in 2021, was one of the artists with whom Olga Zobel Biró opened the world’s first and only gallery for plastic jewelry in Munich in 1992. Their mutual goal was “to show the aesthetic aspect of the material that shaped our century.” Joining them were Gijs Bakker and Paul Derrez from Holland, Thomas Gentile from New York, Pavel Opocensky from Prague, and several other artists. You can still find the word “plastic” in the name of the gallery at the entrance, although plastic has long since been replaced by “author’s jewelry” in the gallery’s concept and on its website. Julie Metzdorf wrote the story of Olga and her daughter Kinga Zobel; Ulrike Myrzik photographed these two protagonists of jewelry art at their apartment in Munich.

    "biography": "The Friedrich Becker Prize has been endowed since 1999 by his widow Hildegard Becker (1928-2018). Especially with his kinetic works and objects, Professor Friedrich Becker (1922-1997) helped to shape contemporary jewelry far beyond the borders of Germany: 129 artists from 21 countries submitted their jewelry and utensils in this year’s competition for the 10,000-euro prize. The jurors – Schnuppe von Gwinner, Leipzig; Dr. Olaf Thormann, Grassi Museum für angewandte Kunst, Leipzig; and Silvia Weidenbach, jewelry artist and lecturer at the Glasgow School of Art – chose the brooches “Jewel_9,” “Jewel_22” and “Jewel_24” by Norman Weber from Kaufbeuren-Neugablonz. These pieces of jewelry to pin on clothing are made of plastic using 3-D printing. Their subtle color scheme was achieved by applying acrylic paints in delicate pastel shades. Norman Weber. Jewel_24 brooch, 2022. Plastic, acrylic paint, stainless steel, 935 silver. Photo: Norman Weber. “Virtuality unites with visionary design and relies entirely on confident use of the digital toolbox. Voluminous spheres, delicately colored fragments, and faceted forms land on dynamic curves. As a snapshot that has become an object, sculptural-looking volume is coupled with ephemeral lightness, overcoming the boundaries between the analogue and the digital, and brilliantly formulating the ineffable ambition of a jewelry designer in our time,” explained Schnuppe von Gwinner on behalf of the jury.

    "biography": "The Munich-based blacksmith and metal designer Otto Baier has been inseparably linked with Bavarian and German arts and crafts for over half a century. He was born in 1943 into one of the oldest smithies in nearby Obermenzing, where he grew up alongside the forge’s fire from the earliest days of his life. After training as a blacksmith, he completed his education with the master craftsman’s examination and the state examination as a graduate designer at the University of Applied Sciences in Aachen.

Otto Baier provides a prime example of the unity of craftsmanship and art, which already manifests itself in many ways in the workshop in Munich. Photo Eva Jünger. In addition to teaching at the master schools for blacksmiths in Munich and Augsburg between 1970 and 1983, he also earned renown as a freelance metal designer. He already participated in the international Kunstschmiedetage in Lindau in 1969 and in the special show “Exempla” at the International Crafts Fair in Munich in 1970. During the more than fifty years of his creative career, he has consistently created metalworks of the highest quality. The spectrum of Otto Baier&#8217;s works also includes commissioned outdoor works such as this metal grille. Photo Eva Jünger. Galerie Handwerk honors his oeuvre with this solo exhibition, which features works from the 1960s to contemporary pieces. The cover story in the autumn 2021 edition of Art Aurea was dedicated to Otto Baier. Copies of that issue are available at Galerie Handwerk for the special price of five euros.",

    "biography": "Featuring jewelry objects, sculptural and conceptual works by 53 artists, this exhibition offers an exciting insight into jewelry-making in Austria dating back to the 1970s. Emphasis is placed on the female protagonists of this period, whose works are presented in relation to specific roles assumed by the middle and young generations of both sexes. This exhibition illustrates the diverse developments in the exciting and heterogeneous jewelry scene that has developed in Austria, thanks to some specific circumstances. Here we are referring, among other things, to the history of the Wiener Werkstätte [“Vienna Workshop”], using the human body as both a subject and object in the visual arts, and the unique attitude to education in this country. The title is a reference to the exhibition “Willful Art: Contemporary Art by Women, 1985” at the Museum des 20. Jahrhunderts [Museum of the 20th Century], Vienna. It was conceived and organized by Ursula Guttmann, Susanne Hammer and Gabriele Kutschera.

Since the late 1960s, the socalled author jewellery has increasingly established itself internationally as an art form. This not only manifests itself in the use of new materials and techniques, but it also reflects and interprets the social, cultural and aesthetic developments of its time. The focus is usually placed on one concept: the use of jewelry as a medium for a statement. Moving away from the notion that jewelry is purely decorative, we see it therefore assuming the form of independent and idiosyncratic objects. This exhibition aims to bring to life developments that have shaped today’s jewelry scene in Austria and to establish cross connections between jewelry works from the early years and those of contempo",

Many other highlights in craft and design likewise aim to delight the audience in Munich. This year’s curator of Schmuck is the British artist Caroline Broadhead, who selected 67 participants from 23 countries from among 600 applicants. Examining and questioning the nature and function of jewelry, as well as references to society and philosophy in the past and the present, are integral parts of the genre. Sigurd Bronger, Brooch Sustainable Construction No. 3, Photo: Sigurd Bronger. Sigurd Bronger’s Sustainable Construction No. 3 transforms a used cardboard roll into a philosophical query. This artist, who is also highly regarded far beyond Norway, is concerned with the meaning of an empty box. What value do we attach to the box when it serves no function? What happens when the empty box is worn as a piece of jewelry? Does it thereby acquire a function? According to curator Caroline Broadhead, jewelry becomes a “carrier of emotion” through its direct relationship to the human body. Whether a piece of jewelry is made of gold or cardboard is solely a question of the story told by the particular piece, Broadhead adds. Zixin Wei: Tesafilm und Jade necklace. Photo: Zixin Wei. Zixin Wei from China used scotch tape and jade in her necklace, which she accordingly named Tesafilm und Jade. These two materials could hardly be more different: the latter is a mythologically charged gemstone, the former is an industrially mass-produced article. Nowadays adhesive strips in countless applications capture motes of dust and stray hairs. United in the necklace, each material and each chain link assumes responsibility for its supporting function and for the cohesion of the whole.

    "biography": "Buzzwords tend to be misused. For example, long before the turn of the millennium, the word “design” was overused and devalued to denote any kind of styling, no matter how banal. Genuinely good design, on the other hand, fulfills lofty and sometimes also ethical conditions. According to Dieter Rams, who is one of the most important designers after 1945, good design must be innovative, usable, aesthetic, understandable, unobtrusive, honest, durable, consistent and environmentally friendly. Born in 1932, Rams is a minimalist who believes that good design should also be “as little design as possible.” Quality criteria such as these likewise apply to contemporary jewelry design, which has its own unique values thanks to its special function and history. Like artistic one-of-a-kind jewelry, jewelry design as we understand it today emerged from the combination of craftsmanship and art since the 1970s. From the beginning, it embodied an antithesis to contentless industrial jewelry. Angela Hübel, Zebra Ring, 750 rose gold.

    "biography": "With the exhibition “Die gute Moderne” the Grassi Museum of the Applied Arts Kunst is currently presenting in its Art Deco pillar hall approximately 600 designs by more than 60 international designers. The artworks were collected by Inge and Wilfried Funke, who repeatedly donated smaller compendiums to the museum and ultimately bequeathed their entire collection of approximately 10,000 objects to the museum in Leipzig. Although the present exhibition displays only a small part of the enormous collection of dishes, vases, cutlery, furniture, lamps and appliances, it offers visitors an exciting overview of 20th-century industrial design, starting with the Bauhaus era, spanning the postwar period, and continuing well into the 1970s. In the process, the phenomenon of “collecting” per se is repeatedly addressed. Urbino coffee service, designed by Trude Petri it in 1947. Sponge-dot decoration added by Enzo Mari in 1995. Cast, glazed porcelain. Staatliche Porzellan-Manufaktur Berlin (KPM). Købenstyle fondue pots; steel, enameled, cast iron. Designed by Jens Harald Quistgaard for Dansk Designs (distribution) in 1954. Central Park teapot, designed by Mikaela Dörfel for Porzellanmanufaktur Fürstenberg. Produced in 2003. Cast, glazed porcelain. Vase No. 15035, designed by Wilhelm Braun-Feldweg in 1959, realized by Peill &amp; Putzler Glashüttenwerke, Düren; glass, mouth blown in form. All photos by Felix Bielmeier. Inge and Wilfried Funke were inspired by their visit to an exhibition dedicated to the designer Heinrich Löffelhardt (1901-1979) at the Badisches Landesmuseum in Karlsruhe in 1980. Afterwards the collector couple tirelessly strove to acquire and document above all the so-called “Good Form” as promulgated by the German Design Council after World War Two. The couple’s nearly forty years of collecting resulted in one of the largest collections of 20th-century industrial utilitarian design. Starting with the designs of Löffelhardt and Wagenfeld, the Funkes also collecte",

The winter issue of Art Aurea – the 50th since our new start in 2010 – focuses on workshops and studios of the present day. Not infrequently, ateliers are closely interwoven with the artists’ homes and lives, as in the article “Credible Confidence” about photographer Sibylle Mania and ceramic artist Martin Neubert. Renate Luckner-Bien visited the artist couple in their beautiful Wilhelminian home on Weimar’s Stadtring. Photographs by Alexander Burzik and Sibylle Mania.

Margit Jäschke and Georg Dobler have ranked among the most important protagonists of contemporary jewelry art for many years. Margit Jäschke comes from Halle an der Saale; Georg Dobler grew up in Pforzheim. Both artists have lived and worked in Halle for more than a decade. In addition to their own creations, there is also plenty of space in their home for works by their friends.

    "biography": "The special “Timeless Silver” exhibition at the Museum im Prediger in Schwäbisch Gmünd (October 23, 2022 – April 10, 2023) focuses on the advantages, versatility and visual properties of the precious metal. In six thematically structured chapters, more than 80 masterpieces of historical and contemporary silversmithing enter into an epoch-spanning dialogue and tell their stories as commissioned works or unconventional artistic creations. Decorative art from the collection of the Gmünd Museum comprise the core of the exhibition. They are complemented by valuable loans from Helga Matzke KG, museum collections and private collections. With further support from the Research Institute for Precious Metals + Metal Chemistry (fem), “Timeless Silver” combines technical innovation with artistic ambition to reveal new perspectives on the shiny metal.

The exhibition explores the diverse techniques that silversmiths use to shape and artistically elaborate the textures and structures of surfaces. This exploration illuminates the continuity of historical working methods up to the present day. Examples of techniques such as casting, chasing, punching, gilding, engraving and etching are shown. The exhibit aims to convey an appreciation of the quality of the characteristic features of production in Central European craft centers in the early modern period. Selected pieces from Augsburg, Nuremberg, Ulm, London and Paris are on display. Wilhelm Widemann (1856-1915), centerpiece Triton with sea nymph, Frankfurt a.

    "biography": "Flowers and art at Brutto Gusto gallery in Berlin-Charlottenburg. Photo def image, Holger Niehaus. There are countless occasions for flowers. They fulfill a recurring need for beauty, bring enchantment to indoor spaces, lift our spirits, spread joy or comfort. A floral bouquet is often a must when visiting friends. Now, during the pre-Christmas season, it is not uncommon for a candle and a fir branch to add a gleam to the darkness or light the way to a contemplative mood. The selection of flowers at Brutto Gusto enjoys ample space atop a large table, where the exquisite blossoms often evoke exclamations of rapt amazement from even the most discerning connoisseurs. Willem Speekenbrink, wall object, 2011, bronze 28 × 16 cm. Photo def Image. On view in the exhibition In Winter at Brutto Gusto, Berlin. The invigorating and colorful splendor of flowers is not the only theme at Wielandstrasse 34 in Berlin-Charlottenburg. While the trained florist Takayuki Tomito looks after the flora and their admirers with quintessentially Japanese self-effacement and subtlety, Geer Pouls is passionate about another subject. As he had done at the former location on Torstrasse, Pouls organizes several exhibitions each year with international greats of glass art, ceramic art, or simply art. Guido Sengle, Vase 2018, porcelain, 22 × 19 cm. Photo def Image. “In Winter” is the name this Dutch-born artist chose for the 2022 Christmas exhibition, which presents a trio of artists who could scarcely be more dissimilar from one another. Ritsue Mishima discovered her passion for glass in Venice approximately 30 years ago, when she was a stylist searching for appropriate vases. She has since become an international star whose glass objects are found in important public collections such as the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam or the Musée d’Arts Décoratifs in Paris. She won the Giorgio Armani Prize in 2001. Awarded the Fondazione di Venezia Award 2022 for the best solo exhibition during Ital",

    "biography": "Every ambitious woodturner strives to make the beauty and liveliness of the natural material wood visible. In his “La Vida” series and the object “Seaside”, Thomas Pildner has gone a step further and created his own distinctive accents. Deep grooves follow the annual rings, growth phases, branches and irregularities, conveying a sculptural impression that goes far beyond a typical lathe-turned wooden vessel. Object La Vida II, WVZ 18/23, 2022, sequoia, ø 55 cm H 24 cm. In the “Tree – Metamorphoses” exhibit at Burg Kronberg, objects are also on display in which the usual idea of a traditional wooden vessel is only marginally perceptible. “People who discover art for themselves,” Pildner says, “notice that wood is not only alive, but can also create impressive linear patterns, contrasts, figures and shapes, like waves on a beach.” Wood can appear monolithic and have an auratic effect, he adds. Working freely with the natural material, Pildner combines traditional artisanal methods with a new artistic language of form. The results are massive, thick-walled objects with attractive surfaces that push the boundaries of the familiar. Wood has never been merely a material for him, says this woodturner and artist. “The essence of my work is already present in the unprocessed wood, which is characterized by its species, its specific grain and its typical coloration, as well as by the ‘fate’ of the individual tree.” Each of these aspects is a great source of inspiration for Pildner. Although he creates many of his works intuitively, he also sometimes makes sketches to help the process. Object Seaside, WVZ 21/47, 2021, sequoia, ø 56 cm, H 26 cm. The objects in the “La Vida” series are likewise first turned “traditionally,” i.e. the workpiece is clamped in the lathe and set into rotation so that the basic body can be formed by cutting and machining with various tools. The body is then worked with various hand tools until it acquires its final shape. Born in Bad Homburg v. d. Höh",

    "biography": "Some people are totally indifferent to art. For others, art means a lot, or even everything, in one form or another. The similarities and differences between art and craft have been a frequent subject for thought discussion. Be that as it may, our autumn edition – the 49th since our magazine’s relaunch in 2010 – features a series of articles which show that early training in a craft or creative activity can often serve as fertile ground for later artistic development. Robert Smit learned to make musical instruments as young teen and began working in a metal factory at age 15. He found humus for his artistic development in the jewelry class of the Kunst und Werkschule in Pforzheim from 1963 to 1966. Afterwards, he designed abstract gold jewelry with precious stones, but sold his goldsmith’s equipment in 1971 in order “to be free again” and began to draw. Liesbeth den Besten describes the subsequent stages in his career. Designs are created on the computer for both the jewelry and the wall-sized drawings by Robert Smit.Photo Wouter Stelwagen. Bokyung Kim and Minsoo Lee discovered their love of porcelain as a material while training with the Korean ceramic artist and teacher Kap-Sun Hwang at Seoul National University in South Korea. But what they turn today on the potter’s wheels at their studio in Diessen, Germany also has to do with the Bauhaus. Although more than a century has elapsed since its founding, the legendary academy still provides rich humus for constructive creativity.

Entries to the sixth edition of the prize will be accepted until 25 October 2022. The 2022 edition of the prize received over 3,100 total submissions from 115 countries and regions across the globe; potential candidates for next year’s edition are invited to submit work at loewecraftprize.com. The LOEWE FOUNDATION Craft Prize was launched in 2016 to showcase and celebrate excellence, artistic merit and originality in modern craftsmanship. It seeks to acknowledge and support international artists who demonstrate an exceptional ability to create objects of superior aesthetic value, with the winner receiving 50,000 Euros. The 2022 winner. Dahye Jeong, Republic of Korea A Time of Sincerity, 2021. Horsehair, 37.5 x 29 x 27 cm.© Loewe Craft Prize. The award, which was conceived by LOEWE’s creative director Jonathan Anderson, aims to acknowledge the importance of craft in today’s culture and to recognise working artists whose talent, vision and will to innovate set a standard for the future. The incentive for the prize goes back to LOEWE’s beginnings as a collective craft workshop in 1846. Jonathan Anderson states: ‘craft is always going to be modern. It is about creating objects that have a formula of their own and speak their own language, creating a dialogue that didn’t exist before. It is about newness as much as it is about tradition.’ An expert panel composed of artists, artists, essayists, curators and designers will consider all submitted works in order to select a shortlist of up to 30 submissions. New additions to the expert panel this year include, Andile Dyalvane (ceramist and finalist of the Craft Prize 2022), Myungtaek Jung (furniture artist and finalist of the Craft Prize 2022), Wolfgang Lösche (Head of Exhibition and Fairs at the Chamber of Skilled Trades, Munich) and Mary Savig (Curator of Craft at the",

    "biography": "Am 25. Mai 2022 hätte Friedrich Becker, 1922 bis 1997, seinen 100. Geburtstag gefeiert. In einer umfangreichen Jubiläumsausstellung wird im Deutschen Goldschmiedehaus Hanau eine Übersicht über das Oeuvre des Goldschmieds und Kinetik-Künstlers geboten und mit zahlreichen Medienstationen kontextualisiert. Becker wollte keinen Schmuck machen, „der immer gemacht worden ist“ wie seine Frau Hilde Becker sagte. Er wollte etwas Neues schaffen. Seine Stücke sollten eine eigene Form besitzen, gleichzeitig aber die schmückende Funktion nie ablegen. Mit diesem Ansteckschmuck gewann Friedrich Becker 1965 den Staatspreis des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen. 1962, Weißgold 750, Orientperlen. Friedrich Becker war ein vielseitig neugieriger und technisch versierter Mensch. Er war zunächst Segelflieger, machte eine Ausbildung zum Maschinenschlosser, studierte Luftfahrttechnik. Während seines Kriegsdienstes wurde er verwundet und stellte sich nach Kriegsende die Frage der beruflichen Existenz neu. Er probierte Zahntechnik aus, bevor er schließlich eine Lehre zum Goldschmied machte, besuchte die Meisterschule für Werkkunst, wurde dort Professor und lehrte zuletzt an der Fachhochschule Düsseldorf. In seinen Schmuckstücken und Objekten ist das „Streben […] selbst zu gestalten, mit den Gesetzen der Physik zu forschen, empirisch zu arbeiten, und mit großer Liebe kinetische Entwicklungen im Schmuckbereich, winzig klein, und im [G]roßen […]“ immanent. Wie kein anderer entwickelte Friedrich Becker technisch höchst anspruchsvollen Schmuck, die Mechanik verbirgt er gekonnt hinter der minimalistischen Formensprache. Mit der Kinetik versuchte er eine chaotische Welt ins Lot zu bringen. Bereits in diesem Ring von 1958 zeigt sich Friedrich Beckers Erfindungsreichtum. Die Enden der auslaufenden Ringschiene aus 750er Gelbgold bilden die Fassung des roten Turmalins. Früher kinetischer Zweifingerring 1987. Edelstahl, synthetischer Rubin. Fotos Michael Berger.

    "biography": "The “Handwerk &amp; Design” [Craft and Design], which is integrated into the IHM, has long been an important international meeting place for aficionados of contemporary jewelry and other disciplines of applied arts and crafts. Leading galleries – this time Rosemarie Jäger, Marzee, Noel Guyomarc’h, Platina, Tinsel Gallery and Siat Gallery – as well as associations, educational institutions and a wide range of individual exhibitors offer a diverse and often high-class range of products for enthusiasts and collectors. Special shows featuring classics and the avant-garde Although outstanding works by internationally renowned artists can always be seen and purchased in the Living “Workshops at “Exempla”, the special show Schmuck – this time curated by Helen Britton – enjoys the highest international standing. The three prizes awarded here are often described as the Oscars of jewelry art. Selected for the Schmuck of Helen Britton: Miki Asai, Japan, Still life1, brooch, 2019, Japanese lacquer, wood, shell, eggshell, mineral pigment, silver leaf, steel, 9 x 12 cm. The special show Talente is likewise important. It presents works by up-and-coming artists who were chosen with great care and expertise. And not to be forgotten is the always meticulously curated exhibition of the Bavarian Arts and Crafts Association with the BKV Prize for Young Arts and Crafts.

    "biography": "Eighty-six professional workshops and international ceramists will present impressive aspects of contemporary ceramic art at Siegburg’s historic market square on July 9 and 10, 2022. The two-day market displays a wide range of different styles. Visitors can expect a contemporary and diverse spectrum including one-of-a-kind ceramics, individual and serially produced utilitarian ceramics, fine porcelain, high-quality jewelry, and porcelain objects as substrates for art. The variety of techniques, artistic styles, colors, shapes and ceramic surfaces is tremendous and offers something for everyone. Young visitors will also have the opportunity to playfully demonstrate their skills in the “Children’s Pottery” workshop from noon to 5 p.m. on both days of the market. Vases by Frank Schillo, ceramist from Cologne, at the Siegburg Ceramics Market. A view of the Ceramics Market in 2018. Pieces by Hasenberg Ceramics Studio. As a preview of the ceramics market, the tourist information office in Siegburg’s ICE train station will display a selection of ceramic works by this year’s exhibitors in its shop window starting at the beginning of June. Parallel to the ceramics market, contemporary ceramic art by Mia Llauder and Joan Serra from Barcelona will be shown in the Stadtmuseum. The exhibition runs from July 9 July to September 4, 2022. The vernissage will take place in the Stadtmuseum at 11:30 a.m. on July 10. Elegant simplicity for purists: bowls by Helene Schrage. Art objects and sculptures are also on display at the Siegburg Ceramics Market. Gundula Sommerer, Object No. 1. Ceramics have been important in Siegburg since the 12th century. Siegburg’s ceramics ranked among the most famous ceramic products in Europe from the Middle Ages to the 17th century. In 2014, the organizers of the ceramics market took the 950th birthday of the town of Siegburg as an opportunity to give a new look to the annual market.

    "biography": "With the “Hofstall” in Lindelbach, Eva Maisch and her husband Walter Jäckl have created a remarkable venue. With gallery space in a former stable, a large inner courtyard and a spacious barn, the converted farmhouse already revealed its potential as a meeting place and exhibition site for the applied arts at its grand opening in 2018. Lindelbach in Lower Franconia is a district of the wine town of Randersacker and is located just twelve kilometers from Würzburg. The outstanding cultural treasures in this historic city by the Main River include a Romanesque cathedral, Marienberg fortress and the noble Residenz, which was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981. Present and future cultural treasures, created through the combination of masterly craftsmanship and creative art, likewise figure among the contemporary jewelry and objects of applied art that Eva Maisch presents at the Hofstall in Lindelbach. The exhibition’s title “Fallen Out of Time” may sound somewhat antiquated, but the gallery owner is referring to a method of production and a level of quality seldom seen among industrially manufactured products. It’s not uncommon to find techniques here that evolved over millennia and have been variously reinterpreted since the modern era. One example is Ulrike Hamm’s colorful parchment jewelry, some of which recalls exotic blossoms or water plants. Parchment replaced papyrus as the substrate for writing in 250 AD. This Berlin-based artist has set herself the goal of researching parchment, in which she continues to discover “undreamt-of possibilities.” Hamm says that parchment is “stubborn, mysterious, lively, precious and unpredictable. It’s a material that wants to be felt, conquered and explored.” Gabriele Hinze has been using the technique of chasing and hammering for more than two decades. These methods were already used in the Bronze Age to produce sculptural jewelry with attractive and sometimes figurative surfaces. “The principle of repetition appeals to",

    "biography": "What are the roles of art and craft? In the summer 2022 print edition, we take a look at an aspect that typically preoccupies science-fiction authors under the title “Time Travel.” If you wish, you can even see a reference to the novel “The Time Machine” by the English author H. G. Wells. In the story, which has also been filmed, a scientist named George travels with the aid of his time machine far into the future, where he encounters the Elois in the year 802,701. The Elios are ruled by the Morlocks, who live underground. In a library George sees that all the books of mankind have crumbled to dust and thus all knowledge has been lost. Kolumba was designed by the Swiss architect Peter Zumthor. Inside, the history of Cologne meets the art of our time. © Kolumba, Köln, Photo Veit Landwehr. One institution that impressively counteracts the loss of knowledge is Kolumba in Cologne. Like hardly any other institution for art, the museum of the Archdiocese of Cologne houses the traces and artworks of past centuries in a dialogue between art, craft and architecture. The remnants of ancient walls bear witness to Cologne’s founding as a Roman colony. The evolution of Christianity in Europe during the Middle Ages is evidenced by four churches built atop Roman foundations between 400 A.D. and the 14th century. Kolumba’s visitors can experience the formerly close connection between religion, education and society, as well as the museum’s openness toward contemporary art and themes of the 20th century and the present. Kolumba is especially important for applied arts and crafts because all genres of art are treated and presented here as peers – and because this museum contributes to ensuring that the works of the past and present do not crumble in the dust of history for us and future generations. Dr. Rüdiger Joppien visited Kolumba for Art Aurea. He takes our readers on an exciting journey through time into meditative spaces where applied, visual and performing arts are presented ",

The state vocational school for plaiting design in Lichtenfels, Upper Franconia, is unique in Europe, where even the ecologically valuable pollarded willows have largely disappeared. This makes the exhibition All Hands On: Plaiting at the Museum of European Cultures in Berlin-Dahlem all the more welcome. The exhibit conveys the fascination and diversity of plaiting and “shows that historically evolved knowledge and modern innovations are interwoven.” Not all ecological products need to be reinvented.

Some 200 plaited artifacts from the museum’s collection and a variety of loaned items are on display at the exhibition, which is divided into four thematic areas: Man, Protection, Material and Pattern. Some of the exhibits are linked to interactive stations, “which are intended to inspire young and old for the intangible cultural heritage and to make the fascination for handmade things ‘graspable.’” Contemporary and historical plaiters are portrayed. The exhibits show how, for example, plaited hats, shoes, baskets and chairs serve people. A wicker chair from the passenger cabin of the zeppelin LZ 120 Bodensee from 1919 bears witness to an era “when the advantageous qualities of wickerwork – namely its stability, lightness and flexibility – were still in demand in aviation.” Totally different: the Living Root Bridges from India are made of interwoven aerial roots of the rubber tree, which is currently also being researched in Europe in the field of construction botany.

    "biography": "There are many reasons for the unrestrained destruction of nature. One of them is the way we treat matter. With their gallery and consulting agency Culturesphere, Ingrid Rügemer and Oliver Szasz draw attention to “the effective power of art, craft and design in the context of ecology and innovation.” The gallerists in Munich add: “The current global crises show that we need to fundamentally reconsider our ways of thinking and acting as individuals and as a society. Doing so, we must be aware that we do not act isolated from the physical world. Instead, our perceptions, emotions, social relationships and even our bodies are shaped by the material world that surrounds us, which thus has a significant impact on our thoughts and actions.” Cara Murphy, Beach Bowls, series of vessels, forged from fine silver on Atlantic coast rocks. Hence, there is a reciprocal relationship between matter and mind, which manifests in our material culture. Consequently, the things we create and surround ourselves with go far beyond form and function: they embody and reflect how we think. Artists and designers have always contributed to shaping material culture, which makes them important players in the context of transformative change.

On view at Galerie Handwerk. Faces &#8211; Faces The theme of “face” has always played a role in the author&#8217;s jewelry. In the exhibition of Galerie Handwerk different approaches of more than 50 international artists are shown. They are pieces of jewelry that are personally colored or hold up a mirror to society, alienated types and stylized countenances that look back at us as necklaces, rings or brooches.

    "biography": "Before the year’s first issue of Art Aurea (Spring 2022) went to press, we too could not have imagined that Putin would invade all of Ukraine with such brutality. Like the entire free world, we are shocked by this war in the midst of Europe. We mourn with the victims, admire the courage of the Ukrainians, their president and their entire leadership. And we stand in solidarity with a nation where the blood of innocent people is spilled for freedom and democracy. The coronavirus pandemic was already a crisis. It highlights human vulnerability even more immediately than the already dramatic effects of the climate crisis and species extinction. But many people imagined that after the pandemic subsided, things could go on as before. The Russian army’s invasion of Ukraine is now bringing the turning point that will give a new direction to our thinking and our lives. We were able to hear how Germany’s parliament reacted to this during the Chancellor’s government statement. First and foremost, the free world’s strong solidarity and unflagging willingness to help must now persevere over the long term – even if it becomes uncomfortable with the passage of time. Art and craft must now prove even more strongly than before that they are important elements of a meaningful and mindful life. We continue to firmly believe in this. Topics of the new print edition 1-2022 Helen W. Drutt English, 91, of Philadelphia, can look back on a fulfilled life as a gallerist, collector, curator, author and tireless protagonist for art and craft. As a child, she experienced both her country’s entry into World War Two and the war’s end. Thanks to her commitment and dedication, especially to ceramics and jewelry art, she participated in breaking down the boundaries between art and craft. Beginning in the 1970s, Helen Drutt’s gallery presented works by the most important jewelry artists from Europe and Germany. She thus not only gave international recognition to this art genre, but also helped to ove",

    "biography": "The current show “Von der Übereinkunft der Elemente” [When All Elements Agree] features work by eight artists from the first generation after 1945, all of whom significantly shaped the development of ceramic art in Germany and expanded its scope from vessel ceramics to independent art objects and sculpture. Each artist accomplished this in their own way, although six of them are couples: the sculptor and ceramist Klaus Lehmann (1927-2016) and his first wife Signe Pistorius-Lehmann (1925-2012), Karl Scheid (1929-2019) and Ursula Scheid (1932-2008), and Gerald Weigel (1925-2019) and Gotlind Weigel (*1932). Works by Beate Kuhn (1927-2015) and Franz Josef Altenburg (1941-2021) complete the spectrum. Signe Pistorius-Lehmann, o. T., 2000, 18 x 22 x 17.5 cm. On view in the exhibition Von der Übereinkunft der Elemente at the Metzger Gallery. The Scheids, the Weigels, and Beate Kuhn became internationally known as the London Group after an exhibition at Henry Rothschild’s Primavera Gallery in London in 1968. Margarete Schott also exhibited at this event. Ursula and Karl Scheid initially focused on decoration and ornament in their vessels, but their earlier floral patterns were followed by more geometric decorations and forms. In his late work, Karl Scheid designed spatial bodies assembled with the utmost precision from individual slabs, often in pairs or in larger, symmetrically ordered groups. The constructive precision and colorful accentuation of the glaze brought these ceramic objects into proximity with Concrete Art. Ursula Scheid, vessel form, 1990, diameter 14 cm. A classic of German ceramics after 1945. Karl Scheid, 2 Forms, 1995, each 30.5 x 11 x 4.3 cm. Vessel forms and objects by Gotlind and Gerald Weigel are likewise diverse and sometimes surprisingly original. Gotlind Weigel cites the ideas of the Bauhaus as formative for her youth and later education. Yet it is not the 90° angle, but “the swinging line” that runs through her work like a connective thread.

Hammers in every shape and size, hammering equipment, pliers, gauges and compasses are still in use here, testifying to the collecting passion of this master plumber and monument conservator.

    "biography": "“Asymptote”: the Rosemarie Jäger Gallery has chosen an unusual title for its presentation of works by two artists who could hardly be more different from each other. In mathematics, an asymptote is a line toward which a curve comes infinitely closer yet never reaches. In layman’s terms, we are talking about two lines that may meet perhaps at an infinitely distant time or place, but never in the here and now. Works by Rudolf Bott in the exhibition “Asymptote” in the Galerie Rosemarie Jäger, photo Johannes Nagel. This is exactly the case with Rudolf Bott and Johannes Nagel. Both men share a profound intellectual involvement with the subject of the vessel, so in this respect they are very close. But they approach the realization of their vessels very differently. On the one hand, there is Johannes Nagel (*1979), who neither turns nor builds his ceramic vessels. Instead, he “digs” them. With his bare hands, Nagel digs cavities in boxes filled with sand, which he then fills with porcelain. Over the years, the hollows in the sand have evolved into complex tunnel systems. The artist cannot see these tunnels while he creates them because his hands grope in the darkness below the sand’s surface. The examining eye, which is so important in this craft, can evaluate the porcelain artifact only after it has been uncovered. The resulting shapes seem to have grown organically. At the same time, Nagel plays with the loss of control: he cannot know in advance exactly how and where the individual parts will ultimately meet. Ceramic sculpture by Johannes Nagel. Photo Johannes Nagel. Nagel’s approach reverses the usual way of making ceramics. Rather than building up, he takes away. This is similar to the work of a printmaker, who begins by cutting into the blank printing block, excising the lines that will later comprise the image. Nagel doesn’t touch his vases during their creation, but one can immediately sense the hand that dug the hollow form. Traces of fingers may remain in a few ",

    "biography": "„Asymptote“ – Unter diesem ungewöhnlichen Titel präsentiert die Galerie Rosemarie Jäger die Werke zweier Künstler, wie sie unterschiedlicher kaum sein könnten. Eine Asymptote ist in der Mathematik eine Linie, der sich der Graph einer Funktion im Unendlichen immer weiter annähert – normalerweise ohne die Linie zu schneiden. Salopp gesagt handelt es sich also um zwei Linien, die sich irgendwo ganz weit hinten treffen mögen – im Hier und Jetzt aber nicht. Gefäßskulpturen von Rudolf Bott und Johannes Nagel. Foto Johannes Nagel. Genau das trifft auf Rudolf Bott und Johannes Nagel zu. Beiden gemeinsam ist ihre tiefe intellektuelle Auseinandersetzung mit dem Thema Gefäß – insofern sind sie sich sehr nah. Doch beide gehen sehr unterschiedlich an die Umsetzung ihrer Gefäße heran. Da ist auf der einen Seite Johannes Nagel (*1979). Seine keramischen Gefäße sind weder gedreht noch gebaut, sie sind „gegraben“: Mit den bloßen Händen gräbt Nagel Löcher in mit Sand befüllte Kisten und gießt diese dann mit Porzellan aus. Die Hohlformen im Sand sind über die Jahre zu komplexen Tunnelsystemen angewachsen, dabei legt der Künstler sie völlig blind an, seine Hände tasten unterirdisch im Dunkeln. Das im Handwerk so wichtige prüfende Auge kann das Objekt erst nach dem Freilegen bewerten. So entstehen Formen, die wie organisch gewachsen wirken. Gleichzeitig spielt Nagel mit dem Kontrollverlust: wie und wo die einzelnen Teile am Ende aufeinandertreffen, weiß er vorher nicht so genau. Keramikskulptur von Johannes Nagel. Foto Johannes Nagel. Nagels Vorgehensweise ist die Umkehrung der üblichen Art, Keramik herzustellen. Er baut nicht auf, er nimmt weg. Das entspricht etwa der Arbeit eines Druckgraphikers, der die Linien, die später das Bild ergeben, erst einmal aus dem Druckstock herausschneidet. Obwohl Nagel seine Vasen bei der Entstehung nicht berührt, spürt man doch unmittelbar die Hand, die die Hohlform gegraben hat. Hier und da kann man noch Fingerspuren erkennen, aber nie zu plakativ, eh",

    "biography": "Ceramic sculptures by Roger and Jacotte Capron are cheerfully colorful and characterized by the carefree southern French lifestyle. Most of the sculptures depict bizarre female figures, their bodies sometimes cubistically dissected, merged with animal shapes or elongated like insects. Galerie de la Perle Noire in Agde, southern France, is now dedicating an exhibition to this French artist couple. Roger Capron, born in 1922, studied applied art in Paris. After teaching for a short time, he opened the Atelier Callis in 1946 in Vallauris, a small town in the hills near Cannes that has been known as a ceramics center since the 16th century. In addition to his poetically caricatured sculptures of women and animals, he also made vases, lamps and other utilitarian objects between 1947 and 1950. Pablo Picasso came to Vallauris in 1948 and remained there for seven years, exerting a long-lasting influence on ceramic art in the town. Picasso became a role model and friend for Roger Capron. Together with other young ceramists who enthusiastically took up Picasso’s impulses, Capron tested not only artistic forms but also new firing techniques and glazes. Ceramic sculpture by Roger and Jacotte Capron. The influence of Pablo Picasso, with whom the artist couple was friends, is clearly visible here. Photo Philippe Capron. Roger Capron opened the Poterie du Font des Horts in 1952. Guided by the concept of well-designed serial products as promulgated by the Bauhaus, he and his employees serially manufactured decorative and utilitarian objects. Artistically decorated tiles and wall objects were added to the roster of products after Roger Capron married his wife Jacotte in 1955. An alumna of an art school, she soon became his closest collaborator, devoting herself mainly to creating the color schemes. In the 1950s, Roger and Jacotte Capron also established themselves internationally with the production of furniture and art objects made of ceramics. Their creations won numerous awards: ",

    "biography": "Während weltweit Wälder brennen und Flutkatastrophen Menschenleben fordern, vermehrt auch in Europa und hierzulande, pochen immer noch viele auf ihre persönliche Freiheit – die Freiheit, überdimensionierte Autos zu fahren, zu reisen, wie oft und wohin man will, täglich Fleisch zu essen, die Böden und das Grundwasser zu vergiften, die absurdesten und unnötigsten kurzlebigen Dinge zu kaufen und vieles mehr. Auch die Sorge um die Lebensgrundlagen zukünftiger Generationen kann sie nicht dazu bewegen, ihre Freiheitsrechte zu überdenken und mit der nötigen Verantwortung für andere, für das Allgemeinwohl in eine neue Balance zu bringen. Die Freiheit der Kunst wurde immer wieder hart erkämpft. Sie ist ein hohes Gut und wo sie unterdrückt wird, sind auch andere demokratische Rechte nicht mehr gewährleistet. Doch sind KünstlerInnen und DesignerInnen in der Regel sensible Menschen und aufgefordert, mehr Verantwortung für die Erfordernisse unserer Zeit zu übernehmen. Nicht wenige haben längst damit begonnen. Einige Beispiele finden sich in der Herbstausgabe von Art Aurea. Der Münchner Kunstschmied und Künstler Otto Baier ist in der elterlichen Schmiede im Stadtteil Obermenzing aufgewachsen. Indem er eine Ausbildung zum Kunstschmied machte und Kundenaufträge sorgfältig ausführt, ist er seiner Verantwortung gerecht geworden, eine der ältesten Schmieden Deutschlands zu bewahren. Mit seinen bildhauerischen Arbeiten kommt er zudem seinem Bedürfnis nach Freiheit nach; ein schöner Beweis, dass sich Freiheit und Verantwortung nicht ausschließen oder wie Julie Metzdorf titelt, „Freiheit mit Tradition“ verbinden lässt. Ein weiteres Beispiel, Freiheit mit Verantwortung zu verbinden, beweisen Gabriele und Christian von Lehsten. Mit dem Erwerb des historischen Gutshauses Rothen in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern und dessen stilvoller Renovierung haben sie sich 2004 einen Lebenstraum erfüllt. Gemeinsam mit anderen GestalterInnen organisiert das Paar Kulturveranstaltungen, regt politische Diskussionen",

Both jewelry artists have been closely associated with Galerie Slavik for a long time. Georg Dobler, Nose beetle brooch, silver with rock crystal drop, blackened silver, l 8 cm. Margit Jaeschke, brooch, silver fine gold plated, plastic. Many-faceted indeed are the oeuvres of both artists, and so is their indirect collaboration. They both work in their own, separate ateliers, and at first sight their work is very different. On closer inspection, however, one constantly notices the depth of their attachment as partners and the fruits of their mutual inspiration. Margit Jäschke’s art jewellery is inseparable from her visual artist’s way of thinking. In fact it is hardly possible to draw a line between Margit Jäschke the visual artist and Margit Jäschke the jewellery and object artist. This rich cross-fertilization results in a great and exuberant freedom. Georg Dobler’s work displays reflections of nature in all its facets. He plays skilfully with geometry and illusions of geometry and draws rich inspiration from the facets of crystals and gemstones. Margit Jaeschke, necklace, silver fine gold plated, plastic. A preference of Georg Dobler are magnificent gemstones. Brooch and ring, 2018. oxidized silver, synthetic spinels.

Today she lives in Beerbach, a rural village in Middle Franconia. But a variety of other influences can be seen in this artist’s ceramics. The entire breadth of her work and a deep insight into the ceramic art of the 1970s in Germany is shown in the exhibition at Brutto Gusto. The early ceramics of the former student of Walter Popp are influenced by abstract and informal painting, as well as the ideas of the British Bernard Leach, who brought the Japanese understanding of ceramics to Europe. Shoulder vase, 1970s, matte green ash glaze, painted over in matte white, 20,5 × 8,5 cm. The subtly applied glaze, with the interaction of fire and ash, turns a simple drinking vessel into an object of meditation. Cylinder mug, dipped matte white from top to bottom, thinly overlaid with briquette ash, pink copper tinge, 12 × 10.5 cm. From her teacher Walter Popp in the 1960s, Heidi Kippenberg learned to handle clay more freely than traditional potters, as well as to look closely and pay attention to every detail. Collar vase, 1972, gray feldspar glaze, copper-red brushstrokes, foot with brown briquette ash. Beerbach, a community of 200 souls near Neustadt an der Aisch. Wilhelm von Witzleben built a small castle in the center of the village around 1700. A vaulted cellar and the nobleman’s coat of arms on a residential building still recall his presence. A few steps away stands a small former farmhouse built in 1924. After Heidi Kippenberg moved into the house in 2006, she redesigned and gave a new purpose to the farmstead, where life and work were never separate. She artistically painted the walls in the low-ceilinged living area. The former stables in the outbuilding now serve as her ceramics workshop. A smaller room houses her kiln. A floor-to-ceiling window and door in the larger room open onto a lovingly tended garden. “I’m like a chicken,” she confesses",

Die Wände im Wohnbereich mit seinen niedrigen Decken hat sie kunstvoll bemalt. Die alten Stallungen im Nebengebäude dienen jetzt als Keramikwerkstatt. Ein kleinerer Raum beherbergt den Brennofen. Den größeren verbindet ein raumhohes Fenster und eine Türe mit dem liebevoll gepflegen Garten. „",

Cotton and wood. Special mention: David Corvalán, Chile, Desértico II, 2019. Copper wire and epoxy resin. Special mention: Takayuki Sakiyama, Japan, Chōtō: Listening to the Waves, 2019.Stoneware. The Loewe Foundation Craft Prize was launched in 2016 to showcase and celebrate excellence, artistic merit and originality in modern craftsmanship. It seeks to acknowledge and support international artisans who demonstrate an exceptional ability to create objects of superior aesthetic value, with the winner receiving 50,000 Euros. The award, which was conceived by Loewe’s creative director Jonathan Anderson, aims to acknowledge the importance of craft in today’s culture and recognise working artisans whose talent, vision and will to innovate set a standard for the future. The incentive for the prize goes back to Loewe’s beginnings as a collective craft workshop in 1846. Jonathan Anderson states: ‘craft is always going to be modern. It is about creating objects that have a formula of their own and speak their own language, creating a dialogue that didn’t exist before. It is about newness as much as it is about tradition.’ An expert panel composed of artists, artisans, essayists, curators and designers will consider all submitted works in order to select a shortlist of up to 30 submissions. New additions to the expert panel this year include, Peter Bauhuis (metal artist and finalist of the Craft Prize 2021), Jiyong Lee (glass artist and finalist of the Craft Prize 2021), Juha Marttila (Loewe Leather Goods Design Director), Kavita Parmar (textile designer) and Zizipho Poswa (ceramicist).

Potenzielle Kandidaten für die nächstjährige Ausgabe sind eingeladen, ihre Arbeiten unter loewecraftprize.com einzureichen. Die Gewinnerin 2021: Fanglu Lin, China mit SHE, 2016. Baumwolle und Holz. Ausgezeichnet 2021: David Corvalán, Chile für Desértico II, 2019. Kupferdraht und Epoxydharz. Ausgezeichnet 2021: Takayuki Sakiyama, Japan: Chōtō: Listening to the Waves, 2019. Steinzeug. Der Loewe Foundation Craft Prize wurde 2016 ins Leben gerufen, um Exzellenz, künstlerischen Wert und Originalität im zeitgenössischen Kunsthandwerk zu würdigen. Sein Ziel ist es internationale Kunsthandwerker anzuerkennen und zu unterstützen, die außergewöhnliche Objekte von hohem ästhetischem Wert zu schaffen. Hauptpreis ist mit 50.000 Euro dotiert. Der von Loewe-Kreativdirektor Jonathan Anderson ins Leben gerufene Preis zielt darauf ab, „die Bedeutung des Handwerks in der heutigen Kultur zu würdigen, ebenso die GestalterInnen, die mit ihrem Talent, ihrer Vision und ihrem Innovationswillen einen Maßstab für die Zukunft setzen“, erklärt die Loewe Foundation. Der Anreiz für den Preis geht zurück auf die Anfänge von LOEWE als kollektiver Handwerksbetrieb im Jahr 1846 zurück. Jonathan Anderson erklärt: „Handwerk wird immer modern sein. Es geht darum, Objekte zu schaffen, die eine eigene Formel haben und ihre eigene Sprache sprechen, die einen Dialog schaffen, den es vorher nicht gab. Es geht um das Neue ebenso wie um die Tradition“. Eine Expertenjury, die sich aus Künstlern, Kunsthandwerkern, Essayisten, Kuratoren und Designern zusammensetzt, wird alle eingereichten Arbeiten prüfen, um eine Auswahlliste von bis zu 30 Einreichungen zu erstellen. Neu in der Expertenjury sind in diesem Jahr Peter Bauhuis, München, (Metallkünstler und Finalist des Handwerkspreises 2021), Jiyong Lee (Glaskünstler und Finalist des Handwerkspreises 2021), Juha Marttila (Loewe Leather Goods Design Director), Kavit",

    "biography": "“Bringing together the colors of the rainbow in the dark!” Being able to do so might be the reason why Finland is allegedly the happiest country in the world. But it is the maxim that guides Jasmin Anoschkin (b. 1980) in her work. Together with five other Finnish artists, she is showcasing recent creations at Marianne Heller’s gallery. Spotlighting ceramics, glass and jewelry, the exhibition is entitled “Finland – Artworks from the happiest country in the world”. The other artists represented are Erna Aaltonen, Johanna Rytkölä, Pekka Paikkari, Heiki Viinikainen and Terhi Tolvanen. Jasmin Anoschkin, ceramic sculpture Rainbow Hippo, 2019. Jasmin Anoschkin paints, draws, and works in wood and ceramic. Colorful handcrafted objects with names like “My Little Poro”, “My Little Rainbow Hairdo” or “Lila Koala”, as well as a life-size wooden sculpture of a horse, painted in red, and entire series of nude drawings, bear witness to an irony-imbued energy and vitality, to an ability to spontaneously translate feelings, thoughts and ideas into seemingly naïve creations with roots in folk art, pop art and toys. Erna Aaltonen, ceramic vessel Sunny, 2019. Erna Aaltonen’s work is themed around vessels. Like Rytkölä and Paikkari, she already exhibited at the gallery in 2010 and 2014. Aaltonen, who was born in 1951, is fascinated by abstract sculptural shapes, particularly the ideal shape of a sphere, which she does not throw on the wheel but hand-builds from thin, ribbon-like stoneware strips. The finely textured surfaces of the fired monumental pieces create captivating reflections of light. The sculptures created by Johanna Rytkölä (b. 1956) owe their graceful presence, reminiscent of dancers swaying to music, to their sumptuously rich colors, their elegance and rhythmic structure. This goes for both her imposing, extraordinarily tall stoneware sculptures and smaller pieces like her Tango vases. Some of her creations evoke associations with the ornamental Art Nouveau style.

Doch es ist die Schaffensmaxime von Jasmin Anoschkin, Jahrgang 1980, die mit fünf anderen Künstlern aus Finnland neue Arbeiten in der Galerie Marianne Heller ausstellt. „Kunst aus dem glücklichsten Land der Welt – Keramik, Glas, Schmuck“, so der Untertitel der Ausstellung, vertreten des weiteren Erna Aaltonen, Johanna Rytkölä, Pekka Paikkari, Heiki Viinikainen und Terhi Tolvanen. Jasmin Anoschkin, Keramikskulptur Rainbow Hippo, 2019. Jasmin Anoschkin malt, zeichnet, arbeitet in Holz und Keramik. Händische bunte Objekte mit Namen wie My little Poro oder My little Rainbow Hairdo, Lila Koala, die lebensgroße, in Rottönen gefasste Holzskulptur eines Pferdes und ganze Serien von Aktzeichnungen, bezeugen eine ironisch gestimmte Energie und Vitalität, eine Fähigkeit, Gefühle, Gedanken, Ideen spontan in scheinbar naive Produkte umzusetzen mit Wurzeln in Folk Art, Pop Art, Spielzeug. Erna Aaltonen, Keramikgefäß Sunny, 2019. Gefäße sind das Thema der 1951 geborenen Erna Aaltonen, die wie Rytkölä und Paikkari bereits 2010 und 2014 von der Galeristin vorgestellt wurde. Aaltonen ist fasziniert von abstrakten, skulpturalen Formen, besonders der Idealform der Kugel, die sie nicht auf der Scheibe dreht, sondern aus dünnen bandartigen Streifen aus Steinzeug aufbaut. Deren fein strukturierte Oberflächen verhelfen dem Licht auf den gebrannten, monumental wirkenden Stücken zu eindrucksvollen Auftritten. Satte, prunkvolle Farbigkeit, Eleganz und der rhythmische Aufbau verleihen den oft eindrucksvoll großen, übermannshohen Steinzeug-Skulpturen von Johanna Rytkölä, geboren 1956, eine geradezu musikalisch-tänzerische Präsenz. Diese geht aber genauso unmittelbar von kleineren Arbeiten wie etwa ihren Tango-Vasen aus. Gelegentlich klingt die Ornamentik des Jugendstils an. Leben ist Bewegung und die Freude daran vermitteln Rytköläs Werke. Kein Wunder, das",

    "biography": "Japan Art is located in the gallery district of Frankfurt’s Old Town, opposite the Museum of Modern Art. It is one of the few art galleries in Germany that exhibits both fine and applied art on a high level. Since the death of the gallery’s founder Friedrich Müller in May 2007, his wife Christa and their two sons Marcus and Alexander have been responsible for the program. An exhibition featuring works by ceramic artist Shozo Michikawa continues until July 17, 2021. Shozo Michikawa, Sculptural Form, 2020. The natural ash touch on the stoneware is created in the anagama (wood-fired single-chamber kiln), 45 x 15.5 cm. Shozo Michikawa was born in a nature park near the active volcano Usu on the island of Hokkaido in northern Japan in 1953. He initially pursued a career in business before coming to ceramics via evening classes. In Seto, one of Japan’s most famous ceramics towns, he first worked in a ceramics factory before developing his own technique and a sculptural formal language based on it. Michikawa has ranked among his country’s most important ceramic artists for many years. His works have been exhibited worldwide and are represented in important public collections. We asked Marcus Müller about the concept of the gallery and the current exhibition. Shozo Michikawa, sculptural form, 2020. Stoneware, glaze tanka with silver, 43 x 16.5 cm. The black coloration is caused by coal in the saggar. Then the silver glaze is applied and the ceramic is fired again at low temperature in the gas kiln. AA What is special about Shozo Michikawa’s works and what do you personally appreciate about them? MM What I appreciate about Shozo Michikawa’s work is the particular sculptural forms and structures that he creates with his unique fabrication technique. Also appealing are his energetic, broken-open forms with their many cracks and crevices, some of which go all the way through the piece. These fissures result from the dynamics of the rotating potter’s wheel. The creation of his w",

In Seto, einem der berühmten japanischen Keramikorte, arbeitete er zuerst in einer Keramikfabrik, bevor er seine ganz eigene Technik und die darauf basierende skulpturale Formensprache entwickelte. Seit vielen Jahren zählt Michikawa zu den wichtigsten Keramikkünstlern seines Landes. Seine Werke wurden weltweit ausgestellt und sind in wichtigen öffentlichen Sammlungen vertreten.

AA Was ist das Besondere an den Arbeiten von Shozo Michikawa und was schätzten Sie daran persönlich? MM An Shozo Michikawa’s Arbeiten schätze ich die besonderen skulpturalen Formen und Strukturen, die durch seine einzigartige Herstellungstechnik entstehen. Reizvoll sind auch die aufgebrochene energetische Formen mit Rissen und Spalten, welche die Werke durchziehen, bis hin zu Durchsichten. Sie resultieren aus der Dynamik der drehenden Töpferscheibe. Die Entstehung seiner Werke wird oft auch mit den Kräften der Natur in Verbindung gebracht – wie etwa bei Felsen, die von Naturgewalten geformt wurden.",

    "biography": "A red-firing clay, which was used to make low-fired utilitarian wares, is found in southern Norway. Marit Tingleff consciously places herself in this tradition and uses the expressiveness of earthenware, which creates a feeling of closeness to the everyday thanks to its simplicity. She recognized early on that European earthenware held many possibilities for artistic exploration. Her encounter with the ceramics of the Danish architect and designer Thorvald Bindesbøll (1846-1908) was formative for her. The freely painted, abstract ornaments of his vessels inspired her to find her own language in this underestimated field of ceramics. As part of the Rhineland-Palatinate Summer of Culture under the motto “Compass Europe: Northern Lights,” the Ceramics Museum Westerwald is now exhibiting works by Marit Tingleff. Marit Tingleff at the Ceramics Museum Westerwald. Doubles, 2018, in the background On the bright side, 2003. Photo Helge Articus. Supported by women Born in 1954, Tingleff studied at the Bergen University of Art and Design and headed the ceramics department at the Oslo Academy of Art [KhiO] from 2013 to 2016. Traditional, everyday, utilitarian ceramics serve as the starting point for her work. Tingleff enlarges plates, platters and bowls into powerful monuments, which thus become a tribute to the women who cared for their “good crockery” and proudly presented it on special occasions. “I want to honor all the hands that carried this dinnerware to the table and the same hands, often women’s hands, that washed these plates and put them away,” she says. Marit Tingleff spontaneously paints the plates freehand with colored engobes. In doing so, she uses an insight from modern painting, in which the ornament emerges from the action. The large dimensions of the substrate liberate the act of painting, with the brushstrokes emerging not from the wrist but from the body. Tingleff washes the speckled, poured and painted layers of slip off the wet clay several times so that ",

    "biography": "Im Süden Norwegens ist ein rotbrennender Ton vorhanden, mit dem man niedrig gebrannte Gebrauchswaren fertigte. Marit Tingleff stellt sich bewusst in diese Tradition und nutzt die Ausdruckskraft der Irdenware, die mit ihrer Einfachheit eine Nähe zum Alltäglichen herstellt. Sie erkannte früh, dass die europäische Irdenware viele Möglichkeiten für eine künstlerische Auseinandersetzung in sich birgt. Eine Begegnung mit der Keramik des dänischen Architekten und Designer Thorvald Bindesbøll (1846–1908) war dafür prägend. Seine Gefäße mit den freibemalten, abstrakten Ornamenten inspirierten sie, ihre eigene Sprache in diesem unterschätzten Bereich der Keramik zu finden. Im Rahmen des Kultursommers Rheinland-Pfalz unter dem Motto „Kompass Europa: Nordlichter“ stellt das Keramikmuseum Westerwald nun Werke von Marit Tingleff aus.

So werden diese zu einer Hommage an die Frauen, die das gute Geschirr pflegten und bei besonderen Gelegenheiten mit Stolz präsentierten. „Ich möchte all die Hände ehren, die dieses Geschirr zu Tisch getragen haben, und die gleichen, oft weiblichen Hände, die es abwaschen und wegstellen mussten“, sagt sie dazu. Spontan und freihändig bemalt Marit Tingleff die Platten mit farbigen Engoben. Dabei nutzt sie eine Erkenntnisse der modernen Malerei, bei der das Ornament aus der Aktion entsteht.

    "biography": "You can already guess who called for lives to be lived as works of art. It was Joseph Beuys, whose 100th birthday is being celebrated in numerous exhibitions this year. This once-in-a-century artist was also important for the applied arts – not only because he nearly got a professorship at the Angewandte in Vienna in 1979. For Beuys, every human being was an artist. Beuys thought radically new, wanted to overcome limits. In this way, he was also a role model for goldsmiths and other craftspeople who, since the 1960s, have defined themselves as artists and overcome ossified boundaries. Art Aurea was born in 1985 out of this spirit of freedom and departure, which is expressed in our editorial philosophy: “As formulated at the beginning of Modernism at the Bauhaus or later by Joseph Beuys, we advocate the idea of art that permeates all areas of life.” Reason enough, then, to focus on Joseph Beuys in his anniversary year of 2021. Despite the seriousness of his art and theses, Joseph Beuys (1981) liked to laugh often. On view until July 4, 21 in the exhibition A Woodstock of Ideas at the Museum Ulm. © Photo archive Ruhrmuseum Essen, photo Jürgen Leiendecker. VG-Bild-Kunst-Bonn-2020. Life as a Work of Art What did Joseph Beuys want to achieve with his statement “Every human being is an artist”? What can we learn from him today, when multiple crises are threatening humankind? Read in Part 1 how the boy from Kleve in the Lower Rhine region became an artist of the century. Arts Crafts World The “Arts Crafts World” section is brand new in Art Aurea.

    "biography": "Sie ahnen schon, wer ein Leben als Kunstwerk gefordert hat. Es war Joseph Beuys, dessen 100-jähriges Geburtsjubiläum in diesem Jahr in zahlreichen Ausstellungen gefeiert wird. Der Jahrhundertkünstler war auch für die angewandte Kunst wichtig. Nicht nur, weil er 1979 in Wien fast eine Professur an der Angewandten erhalten hätte. Für Beuys war jeder Mensch ein Künstler. Beuys dachte radikal neu, wollte Grenzen überwinden. Damit war er auch ein Vorbild für GoldschmiedInnen und andere HandwerkerInnen, die sich seit den 1960er Jahren als KünstlerInnen definiert und erstarrten Grenzen überwunden haben. Art Aurea entstand 1985 aus diesem Geist der Freiheit und des Aufbruchs, der in unserer Redaktionsphilosophie zum Ausdruck kommt: „Wie bereits zu Beginn der Moderne am Bauhaus oder später von Joseph Beuys formuliert, befürworten wir die Idee von Kunst, die alle Lebensbereiche durchdringt.“ Grund genug also, uns in seinem Jubiläumsjahr 2021 mit Joseph Beuys zu befassen. Trotz der Ernsthaftigkeit seiner Kunst und Thesen lachte Joseph Beuys (1981) gerne und oft. Zu sehen bis 4. Juli 21 in der Ausstellung Ein Woodstock der Ideen im Museum Ulm. © Fotoarchiv Ruhrmuseum Essen, Foto Jürgen Leiendecker. VG-Bild-Kunst-Bonn-2020.

    "biography": "Carl Dau, who was born in 1942, was a mariner before he started to train as a goldsmith when he was 23. Afterwards, he worked as a journeyman goldsmith, studied at the State Drawing Academy in Hanau and at Berlin University of the Arts, and then was an instructor for goldsmiths for several years. He subsequently set up his own jewelry company, and strongly influenced the jewelry culture in the 1980s and 1990s with his minimalist designs. His material of preference, stainless steel, tapped into the pulse of the era, and kindled design-minded people’s – including many men’s – interest in jewelry. Pendant weniger geht kaum 1, [less is hardly possible 1], 1998. 1 x 750 gold, 1 x steel, 925 silver.Ringe, weniger geht kaum 2 [less is hardly possible 2], 1988. 750 gold, stainless steel. Carl Dau has always regarded himself as a designer who develops series. Accordingly, his pieces don’t have much in common with the traditional goldsmith’s craft. “I wasn’t interested in copying artisanal work, like some people thought.” His ideal was a kind of clarity that does not embellish or conceal anything but, quite the contrary, openly reveals the underlying concept. This results in “a different kind of value, i.e. of honest, clearly evident series-production work, which is mainly performed by special machines according to precise specifications.” Also, he has never been tempted to create jewelry tailored to customers’ requirements. The only thing that matters to him are, and have always been, his own ideas and their implementation, the designer explains. Object der reiz des minimalen, [The charm of Minimalism], 2002. Steel, Corian. 100 x 100 cm. Knowing that there are people all over the world who have an affinity for minimalism, Carl Dau showcased his pieces at the major jewelry fairs in Munich and Basel, and won over discerning galleries and jewelry shops as retailers. After the turn of the millennium, he started to create, in addition to jewelry, large-format wall objects made of",

    "biography": "Almost as if by chance – or was it serendipity? – the idea of the Gesamtkunstwerk as a theme for an edition of the magazine took shape during the creation of our first print issue in 2021. In the end, we are convinced that it is worthwhile to look at contemporary applied art from this aspect as well. The magazine will be released on March 9 – not at newsstands until further notice due to the coronavirus pandemic, but in leading galleries for jewelry and applied arts. We’ll announce the list of galleries in advance in this blog. Here’s an overview of the topics: Walking in the Void Monica Guggisberg and Philip Baldwin have enjoyed great success with their medium of glass. They have staged solo exhibitions in museums and installations in cathedrals. They are represented in numerous collections. They have collaborated with Rosenthal and are still collaborating with Venini. In a solo exhibition at the Danish Glass Museum in Ebeltoft, the artist duo takes a close look at the biggest picture of all. World made of glass: Philip Baldwin (right), with two employees in the &#8216;Hotshop&#8217;. Grandpa Wooley He’ll probably never become as famous as Kurt Schwitters, but he too has surely created a remarkable Gesamtkunstwerk: Wolfgang Lieglein, who called himself Wolli the Kid at the beginning of his creative work, later Master Wooley, and in the end Grandpa Wooley. Art Aurea recollects a jewelry artist who transformed his Berlin apartment into a total work of art of Pop Art. Last glimpses: Detail of Grandpa Wooley&#8217;s living room. Photo Petra Jaschke. Dedicated to the History of Ceramics Heinz-Joachim Theis shows what one individual can create when he’s really enthusiastic about a subject. Despite the coronavirus, Rüdiger Joppien visited the gallery owner and director of the Ceramics Museum Berlin.

    "biography": "Art Aurea What has the past year of coronavirus meant for you personally and economically? Ursula Biskup First of all, I am happy to have my workshop in my home, where I can work safely and undisturbed. Fortunately, most of the galleries and stores I work with have also come through the crisis reasonably well so far, so I have had enough to do. There was even a lot more buying than usual last summer, perhaps instead of a vacation or even as a consolation. All in all, 2020 was better for me economically than I had feared. AA What reactions did the pandemic trigger in you? UB During the first lockdown in the spring of 2020, it seemed as though nothing was the same as it used to be. I suddenly felt totally lost and isolated. Simply continuing to work quietly and with my focus limited to my worktable was not an option. First I dug up the garden and created wildflower beds, then I discovered how useful Instagram could be. It might sound banal, but it was an effective way for me to combat isolation and stagnation. In times of shuttered museums and closed exhibitions, Instagram kept me connected to the outside world, where there are so many new and interesting things to discover. It also offered a new way to show my jewelry: often spontaneously, with photos I’d taken myself &#8230; and sometimes evoking immediate reactions. AA How did things continue after the initial shock wore off? UB Over the course of the year, I’ve become increasingly aware of how lucky I am to have my own workshop and to do handicrafts. How good it is now to simply be able to make beautiful and tangible things that also bring joy to others! Working at the goldsmith’s workbench fulfills Ursula Biskup. Other crafts such as sewing, weaving and embroidery also come easily to her. The clarity and thoughtful design of Ursula Biskup’s jewelry series are reflected by the orderliness of her workshop in Neuss. In addition to minimalist necklaces, Ursula Biskup’s favorite theme is jewelry for the ears in a wide",

In addition to the permanently displayed range of vessels and sculptures made of ceramics, porcelain, glass and metal, there were also solo exhibitions several times a year featuring international greats such as the ceramic artists Morten Løbner Espersen, Guido Geelen, Johannes Nagel or Guido Sengle. Geer Pouls, who is responsible for the gallery section, keenly appreciated works by glass artists such as Ritsue Mishima or Massimo Micheluzzi. But this Dutchman also has a flair for original vintage vases and surprises us with the surrealistic objects by Johanna Schweizer. All this became an inspiring, sensual dialogue between art and nature with a table adorned by magnificent flowers or twigs and the floristic skills of his partner Takayuki Tomita. The complete program has been available since November 2020 on the new premises at Wielandstrasse 34 in Charlottenburg. Geer Pouls says: “After twelve years of being established in Berlin-Mitte, we are following the natural cyclic moves of the gallery scene, getting ready to open our doors with refreshed excitement at our new address in Charlottenburg. There is nothing better than to celebrate this occasion by presenting a selection of what has shaped our reputation in the city’s setting – containers/sculptures made of ceramic, porcelain, glass and metal made by a careful pick of our roster of artists who are reviving the international circuit of contemporary crafts – tradition with a touch of nonconformity.” Founded in Rotterdam 32 years ago, Brutto Gusto continues to thrive with “a concept that blurs the boundaries between fine arts, crafts and horticulture.” The first exhibition of Brutto Gusto 2021 is dedicated to the Dutch Wietske van Leeuwen.

Doch hat der Niederländer ebenso ein Gespür für originelle Vintage-Vasen oder überrascht mit den surrealistisch anmutenden Objekten einer Johanna Schweizer.

Januar mitteilt, müsse die Handwerksmesse „als Konsequenz der anhaltenden Bestimmungen zur Eindämmung der Coronapandemie abgesagt werden. Eine Verschärfung der Maßnahmen und fehlende Planungssicherheit führen zu dieser Entscheidung.“ Weiter heißt es: „Die GHM Gesellschaft für Handwerksmessen mbH als Veranstalterorganisation hat heute entschieden, die Internationale Handwerksmesse (IHM) mit der ‚Handwerk &amp; Design‘ sowie die Garten München für das Durchführungsjahr 2021 abzusagen. Damit kann das jährliche Gipfeltreffen des Handwerks zum zweiten Mal in Folge pandemiebedingt nicht stattfinden. Hintergrund ist die Fortschreibung der Maßnahmen zur Eindämmung der Pandemie auf Bundes- und Länderebene mit verschärften Maßnahmen im Bereich der Kontaktbeschränkungen und -vermeidungen. Alljährlich besuchte Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel die Internationale Handwerksmesse. Hier beim Rundgang 2019. Photo IHM. Dieter Dohr, Vorsitzender der Geschäftsführung der GHM Gesellschaft für Handwerksmessen mbH, zu dieser Entscheidung: ‚Das Verbot zur Durchführung von Messen wurde letzte Woche erneut verlängert und die bereits bestehenden Maßnahmen zur Eindämmung der Pandemie massiv verschärft. Mit weiteren Verlängerungen ist zu rechnen. Diese Entwicklungen und die damit einhergehende Planungsunsicherheit erlauben uns leider kein anderes Vorgehen. Wir danken allen Ausstellern, die bis zuletzt mit uns auf eine Durchführung gehofft haben – und das sind weit über 80 Prozent der ausstellenden IHM-Familie. Wir schöpfen aus diesem ungebrochen hohen Zuspruch der Branche Kraft und nehmen das als Motivation und Ansporn, die kommende Veranstaltung zu einem vollen Erfolg zu führen – mit vielen Neuerungen für Aussteller und Besucher, für alle, die Zukunftstrends im Handwerk suchen und diskutieren wollen.‘ Regelmäßig vertreten im Bereich „Handwerk &amp; Design“ ist der Bayerische Kunstgewerbeverein wie diese Aufnahme von 2019 belegt.

    "biography": "Contemporary arts and crafts from Bavaria are being shown in a museum of modern art, architecture, graphics and design. Petra Hölscher from Die Neue Sammlung explains that the exhibit for the Danner Prize 2020 focuses on an important aspect of the program of the Pinakothek der Moderne: the interactions between so-called “fine” and applied art. The exhibition of the Danner Prize 2020 in the Pinakothek in Munich was designed by Isolde Bazlen. Photo: Danner-Foundation, Eva Jünger. Bettina Dittlmann, Danner Prize 2020, brooch Wohin [Where to], iron, solder, enamel, garnets, pyrite, neodymium magnetic disk. Photo: Danner-Foundation, Eva Jünger.Endowed with 20,000 euros, the 13th conferral of the Danner Prize in 2020 marked the foundation’s 100th anniversary. The winner was the jewelry artist Bettina Dittlmann with her magnetic brooch Wohin (Where To?). “Without formulating a final shape, Bettina Dittlmann uses magnets in her jewelry to give a new form to residual and nonprecious materials such as tinder, iron filings or iron wire,” said Angelika Nollert, director of the Neue Sammlung. This radical commitment to renewal, participation and change lends social and political relevance to her work, Nollert added. In this sense, her jewelry also invites its wearers to actively shoulder responsibility. Honorary prizes went to Otto Baier for his titanium objects Stromboli and Vulkano, to Peter Bauhuis for four of his Sculpture/Chain objects, to Petra Bittl for her ceramic vessels Paar [Pair] and Wintergestalt [Winter Shape], and to Paul Müller for his candlesticks. Paul Müller received a Danner Honorary Award 2020 for his slender candleholders. Here the presentation in the exhibition in the Pinakothek der Moderne. Photo: Danner-Foundation, Eva Jünger.

Joint Smithing Projects Today Michael Schimmel works together with his son Janos Freuschle &#8211; formerly also with Wilfried Moll. Inspired by two freestanding chandeliers at the funeral service of the important silversmith, Rüdiger Joppien visited the art blacksmith Michael Schimmel and his family. This developed into the story of a family in which new design ideas nourish the blacksmith’s craft. Rüdiger Joppien has also woven a kind of obituary for Wilfried Moll.

Due to the decision of the Federal Chancellor and the heads of government of the federal states on 28 October 2020, the fair must be cancelled in 2020. The organisers are confident that they will be able to hold the Zeughausmesse 2021 again. Following the original announcement: The Zeughausmesse opens its doors in Berlin for the 24th time. Due to renovation of the Zeughaushof, it will not take place as usual in the German Historical Museum, but in KühlhausBerlin. The industrial architecture of the building at Luckenwalder Strasse 3 offers space for over 100 participants on four floors, as well as two special exhibitions: one by Haus Brandenburg, the other by the HAWK University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Hildesheim. The Haus Brandenburg initiative originated from a project of the Potsdam University of Applied Sciences and combines crafts with design to create regional, sustainable products. Prototypes of furniture and home furnishings are on display. Students of the Faculty of Design at the HAWK in Hildesheim present works from various disciplines including graphic design, interior design, metal design and product design.

Born in The Hague in 1957, Barbara Nanning studied ceramics at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam four decades ago. Since then she has developed into an internationally renowned artist whose works are represented in numerous museums and private collections in the Netherlands and abroad. Nanning achieved fame with her unconventional ceramic objects and installations. For the past 25 years, she has also devoted herself to glass art. Art Aurea What prompted you to concentrate on ceramics during your art studies 40 years ago? Barbara Nanning As a 10 year old qirl I already turned small shapes on a shovel disk on street art fairs. I wanted to work with clay and other materials from an early age and make beautiful refined products. AA Could you describe the Zeitgeist of the era during which you studied in Amsterdam in the 1980s? What expectations did you have for your studies at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie? BN My study period was in the transition phase of tableware, which were then produced in ceramic factories, and the beginning of small private studios. The tendency at the academy was to make tableware by hand turning and casting in plaster molds. At that time you chose one department and there was little to no space for using and combining various materials in one product. My expectation was to first learn the techniques well and to be able to combine various materials in efinitely in order to achieve the desired end result. AA Did you have any role models? And what did you want to do differently? BN I was not interested in the Dutch teaching of concentrating on making functional consumer goods. My role model was the Dutch artist Harm Kamerlingh Onnes (1893–1985). He made drawings, watercolors, gouaches, oil paintings and ceramics. Harm Kamerlingh Onnes is best known for the small, humorous character sketches of everyday life in the form of painted tiles, animal and human fi",

    "biography": "Around twenty of Walter Bosse&#8217;s humorous ceramics can be seen from September 10, 2020 at Brutto Gusto in Berlin. Walter Bosse (1904, Vienna–1979, Iserlohn, Germany) was an artist, designer and ceramist whose oeuvre is represented in numerous private collections and museums in Austria and abroad. Well known for his brass figurines designs, it was in his early ceramic production where he undoubtedly manifested the best of his iconic creativity and originality. On spotlight is a selection of approximately twenty rare ceramic figures, most of them dated between 1924 to 1937, an era when he crafted in his original atelier in Kufstein. Udo Kittelmann on Walter Bosse Knowing about the past sometimes makes us want to wish ourselves back to bygone days. In such dreamy moments we imagine witnessing this or that historical event, strolling through legendary places and streets, meeting some particular person. I have felt like that ever since I found out that Kafka’s fiancée Felice Bauer lived just round the corner from my Berlin home. Once, sitting in Ascona in Switzerland, writing this little piece, I briefly imagined being part of the Monte Verità counter-cultural movement of the early twentieth century. And when I think about Walter Bosse, I see myself sauntering through the past, no later than 1938, let’s say, and standing outside the “Bosse shop” in the Austrian town of Kitzbühel to see all the wonderful ceramic creations on display, together, for the first time in that most cramped of spaces. I can also see myself going into the shop and leaving it again with my first ceramic figure by Walter Bosse, a chubby lad with a concertina, intended to be the start of a little collection. Walter Bosse&#8217;s ceramics were created in his studio in Kufstein between 1924 and 1936. So who was Walter Bosse? He was born in Vienna in 1904. He showed signs of artistic talent at a very young age, and trained first of all at the arts and crafts school in what was then the Museum für K",

Unlike the first competition in 2017, this year the states of Hesse and Thuringia were included along with Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Württemberg. Another new feature was that the competition was not publically advertised, but that each of the five jurors was asked to nominate two ceramists. Ten artists accordingly comprised the group of candidates, which consisted of the winner Monika Debus, as well as Uwe Löllmann, Heide Nonnenmacher, Sebastian Scheid, Martin Schlotz, Guido Sengle, Sebastian Stöhrer, Thomas Weber and Song Zhifeng, who is currently studying in Höhr-Grenzhausen. The following cooperation partners are involved in the event: the Bund der Kunsthandwerker Baden-Württemberg e.V., the Badisches Landesmuseum Karlsruhe and the Ceramic Museum Westerwald. Martin Neubert&#8217;s Clown, 2018. Clay, engobe, glaze, metal, height 52cm. The prizewinner’s works will be on display at the Keramikmuseum Westerwald from September 4 to October 14, 2020. Martin Neubert was born in Kleinmachnow in 1965 and now lives in Weimar and Halle/Saale. After an apprenticeship as a potter with Christine Freigang in Bürgel, he studied at the Kunsthochschule Halle Burg Giebichenstein from 1988 to 1993, where he has been a professor in the field of sculpture and ceramics since 2009.

    "biography": "Arnold Annen (born in 1952) is a guest in the Marianne Heller Gallery for the second time since 2014. This time, Annen is accompanied by Violette Fassbaender (born in 1958), with whom he shares his life and his workshop. At first glance, a viewer of works by these two Swiss artists primarily notices their differences: Arnold Annen’s translucent, thin-walled, seemingly floating white bowls and objects are made of porcelain; Violette Fassbaender’s exciting, self-contained bodies consist of porcelain and stoneware. But closer and repeated observation reveals their affinities. Both artists present us with erratic boulders from the realm of the invisible, seemingly made only of light; highly fired and very hard porcelain membranes; sculptures resembling single-celled organisms reminiscent of our oceanic origins; relics of the Earth’s history composed of Matterhorns and moraine landscapes of the imagination: perfect, ingenious craftsmanship in the service of great art. Violet Fassbaender first came into contact with ceramic art in Japan. Here: the artist in her workshop in Basel. Violet Fassbaender, Blooming. Ceramic objects reminiscent of the history of the Earth. Violette Fassbaender, Drift. Powerful forms and sensitively designed surfaces. These objects take shape at Violette Fassbaender’s Basel parental home in the immediate vicinity of the historic city center. Music (her parents were professional musicians), painting, architecture, landscapes, especially the landscape of Lake Constance, where she spent many holidays and, of course, the Alps, all left their marks, which are visible in Fassbaender’s sculptures. But the decisive factor was her experience as an exchange student in Japan, where she first came into contact with pottery and instinctively knew that she had found the subject of her lifework. She remained in Japan for eight years and learned every aspect of the ceramist’s craft, first at the renowned Tekisui Institute in Ashiya, then as assistant to the artis",

    "biography": "With the awarding in Düsseldorf of the Friedrich Becker Prize, worth 10,000 Euro and an endowment of Hildegard Becker (1928-2018), the Association for Goldsmiths’ Art (Gesellschaft für Goldschmiedekunst e.V.) has been commemorating the eminent goldsmith Professor Friedrich Becker (1922-1997) since 1999. This year, owing to the prevailing circumstances, the award ceremony will take place in the digital space on the specially created site www.fbp2020.com. 151 artists from 16 countries entered jewelry and silver hollow- and flatware for the Friedrich Becker Award. Junwon Jung won the Friedrich Becker Prize 2020 with 3 jewerly objects of this kind. Constructivist jewelry dominated the Friedrich Becker Prize in 2020. The jury – Sam Tho Duong and Cornelie Holzach, Pforzheim; Prof. Andrea Wippermann, Wismar – opted to award the Prize to Junwon Jung from Munich for his three brooches Boxes. The jury’s decision in their own words: “The convincing element of the pieces by Munich-based Korean Junwon Jung is their technical refinement: there is this surprising effect when box turns into brooch. An extremely interesting game between two- and threedimensionality, produced solely by flexing and tucking the metal. The boxes’ mobility enables the display of a different perspective with each configuration of the pieces. The concealed stitching on the interior appears when the box is folded in a specifically created cut-out, whose form arises from its function. With the complementing boxes made of birch, pear and lime wood, the brooches become an exciting ensemble.” A fine wooden box always belongs to the foldable jewelry object by Junwon Jung. Award-winning jewelry object by Junwon Jung. In 2016 Junwon Jung (*1978) completed his Master Pupil’s certificate under Prof. Otto Künzli and Prof. Karen Pontoppidan at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich; he has been distinguished with the Bavarian State Award (2016) and the Herbert-Hofmann Award (2019).

But the story about the embroidering Expressionists and today’s renaissance of embroidery art fits well with the current situation, partly because some artists from that era also experienced the Spanish flu, a pandemic that occurred in three waves between 1918 and 1920 and claimed between 27 and 50 million lives from a global population of 1.8 billion. August Macke and Franz Marc did not live to see it: they were among the nine million soldiers who died in World War One. Vanessa Oppenhoff uses her embroidery to comment on current comic-like events. “The thorough civilan“, 2016. Thread, vellum, acrylic, newsprint, gouache, 35 x 41.5 cm. Privately owned.

We can draw courage from the fact that visionary ideas and lastingly inspiring artworks were conceived in such a catastrophic era. Especially the Expressionists’ efforts to link art and life remain as relevant today as does the call for complete equality of women and men – so anyone who feels the urge to embroider can do so. The Bavarian artist Florian Lechner found his life’s work during a pilgrimage to Chartres Cathedral: deeply moved by Gothic stained glass windows, he set out to create modern variations for light-flooded rooms (see page 10). Enamel, the material to which Jamie Bennett has devoted himself since his years as an art student, is related to glass. This American has worked with enamel for 50 years, conjuring jewelry with patterns and colors that recall natural forms, calligraphy or Islamic ornaments (see p. 20).

    "biography": "Eigentlich war der Beitrag „Mit Stich und Faden“ auf Seite 40 gar nicht vorgesehen. Doch machte das neue Coronavirus auch ein Teil unserer Planung zu Makulatur. Miriam Künzli musste ihren Phototermin bei dem Schweizer Keramiker Arnold Annen in Basel ebenso streichen wie Rüdiger Joppien sein Interview bei Heinz-Joachim Theis vom Berliner Keramikmuseum. Doch passt die Geschichte über die stickenden Expressionisten und die Renaissance der Stickkunst in der Gegenwart gut zur aktuellen Situation. Nicht nur, weil einige KünstlerInnen jener Epoche auch die Spanische Grippe erlebten. Die damalige Pandemie fand in drei Wellen zwischen 1918 und 1920 statt und forderte – bei einer Weltbevölkerung von 1,8 Milliarden – zwischen 27 und 50 Millionen Menschenleben. August Macke und Franz Marc erlebten sie nicht mehr, sie starben mit neun Millionen anderer Soldaten im 1. Weltkrieg. Dass in einer solch katastrophalen Zeit visionäre Ideen und eine Kunst entstand, die bis heute begeistert, sollte Mut machen. Zumal das Ansinnen der Expressionisten, die Kunst mit dem Leben zu verbinden, weiter aktuell bleibt, ebenso wie die vollkommene Gleichstellung der Frauen und auch der Männer – damit jeder unbeschwert sticken darf, der Lust dazu verspürt.

    "biography": "After apprenticing in ceramics and earning a degree in industrial design in Munich, Ulrike Umlauf-Orrom (born in 1953) began her master’s studies at the Royal College of Art in London, where she discovered glass as a medium. Her first works were freely blown drop-shaped objects, sensitively balanced, cut and covered with sand-blasted textures. She then turned to sand casting, a technique that gave her greater artistic freedom and resulted in poetic sculptures which allow multiple interpretations thanks to her conscious use of diverse surfaces, along with inclusions of color and metal. The desire to be able to work self-sufficiently in her atelier and to shape the molten glass prompted her to invent her own variant of glass fusing: panes of glass, colored with enamel, are melted in a kiln and formed. Glass bowl by Ulrike Umlauf-Orrom. Through multiple layers, air inclusions and the overlapping of colour threads she achieves structures of great density and depth. Wavy glass bowl by Ulrike Umlauf-Orrom, 46 x 38 x 6 cm, 2010. Objects like this are inspired by Japanese fabric and paper patterns, their order, reflection and symmetry. Ulrike Umlauf-Orrom has been profoundly inspired by the complexity of Japanese textiles ever since her studies in London, where she became acquainted with Japanese applied art. In her fusing works, she achieves glass of an almost fabric-like quality by means of parallel or intersecting colored lines. In expressive variations, the surface of the glass is opened and enlivened by grid structures. In her “padded objects,” which are inspired by the reinforcing platelets of samurai armor, air pockets are melted into the glass during the fusing process. This lends a haptic quality to the visual three-dimensionality of the surface. Glass bowl “Balance”, created by using the fusing technique, 28 x 28 x 15 cm, 2013. References to Op Art also echo in Ulrike Umlauf-Orrom‘s objects. Japanese textile art with its colors and patterns is a constant source of",

This year&#8217;s prize winners are Melanie Isverding and Katrin Feulner from Germany and Carla Nuis from the Netherlands. The jury, consisting of Professor Otto Künzli from Munich, Jantje Fleischhut from Düsseldorf, Dr Gert Bruckner from the Danner Foundation Munich, and Dr Sabine Runde from Frankfurt, met on Friday 13 March 2020, some of them virtually, to select the three award winners. Ring made from thin gold sheeting by Carla Nuis, Netherlands. Carla Nuis Carla Nuis’ gold ring appears solid and heavy at first glance. It is actually made of wafer-thin welded gold sheeting, which makes it hollow and light as a feather. If the ring is worn, the first handshake would deform the ring and change its shape. This reveal its real nature – fragility. This convinced the jury to award the Herbert Hofmann Prize to Carla Nuis. “This work shows the never-ending interplay between appearance and being. The ring is not intended for eternity, but is change embodied, a claim to infinity is transformed into perishability.” Necklace from ebony, silver, cotton, and palladium plating by Melanie Isverding, Germany. Melanie Isverding “Melanie Isverding‘s large-format necklace with palladium-coated circular discs impresses with a very sophisticated graphic reduction and exciting composition,” the jury explained. “The fine-tuned black tones of the ebony frame, the woven cotton field, and the blackened silver hanger contrast with the circular discs. The symmetrically constructed frame also contrasts with the two disks, which could be interpreted as heavenly bodies, suggesting the movement of planets. When dealing with weaving processes, reference is made to the Greek mythology of weavers. The creation of textile fabrics is seen as a metaphor for the emergence of thought structures, stories, and a design to look at t",

The gallery’s owner Atinuj Tantivit – her friends call her Atty – collected jewelry herself before opening the first and thus far only gallery for this genre in her country. Questions for a pioneer of art jewelry in the Far East. The Thai gallery owner Atinuj Tantivit enthusiastically wears contemporary jewelry. Art Aurea You had already collected art jewelry before your time as a gallery owner in Bangkok. How did that happen? Where did you first get to know contemporary jewelry? Atinuj Tantivit I started collecting Native American jewelry when I was studying and living in the USA between 1994 and 2004. After graduating in Marine Resource Management in Miami, I worked in the field of marine science for a while and I took up jewelry-making as a hobby, but I soon wanted to make jewelry more than to go to work. It was at this time that I bought my first piece of what would be considered “contemporary jewelry.” It was created by Gabrielle Gould, an American artist represented by a local gallery that sells arts-and-crafts items. After considering my options, I decided to leave the field of marine science and started exploring the jewelry world. I thought I needed to know more about gems, so I enrolled at the GIA in California to study gemology. At that time, I searched for books about modern jewelry even though I didn’t yet know anything about contemporary jewelry and the contemporary jewelry movement was not big in the USA. My interest prompted me to take courses in jewelry-making in Europe, where I stayed from 2004 to 2008. I bought my first piece of European contemporary jewelry at Louise Smit’s gallery in Amsterdam. It was Beppe Kessler’s “never a dull moment” necklace. Most of my early education in the field of contemporary jewelry came from books. I still have a large collection of books relating to jewelry at the ATTA gallery. My first eye-opening experience was the “Schmuck” exhibi",

    "biography": "Their works are highly valued by collectors and have fetched top prices at auctions for years. Expelled from Germany by the Nazis, they played a decisive role in shaping postwar studio ceramics in Great Britain. We are talking about Lucie Rie and Hans Coper. Hans Coper was born in Chemnitz on April 8, 1920. His father Julius Coper was a successful textile entrepreneur. Hans and his five-years-older brother Walter grew up in an upper middle-class milieu. After the Nazis seized power in 1933, they prohibited Julius Coper from working because he was Jewish. Julius Coper took his own life in June 1936, either to protect his non-Jewish wife Erna or perhaps out of desperation. His son Walter emigrated to Argentina in 1937. Hans hid in Wiesbaden for six months and then went to England. He never visited Germany again. Hans Coper was arrested as a refugee in England in May 1940 and sent by ship, along with other displaced persons and prisoners of war, to an internment camp in Canada, where he met Fritz Wolf, an artist from Breslau. During their discussions, the desire to become a sculptor grew in Hans Coper. By registering with the Pioneer Corps, a unit that carried out construction and supply work for the British Army, Coper was able to leave the camp and return to England. Hans Coper with Lucie Rie in the workshop Coper was discharged from duty in 1943 and struggled to make ends meet by taking on odd jobs. Shortly after the war’s end and on the recommendation of the gallery owner William Ohly, he began working as a temporary assistant in a potter’s studio where buttons were made. The workshop was run by Lucie Rie (née Gomperz) from Vienna: a trained potter, Rie had likewise fled to England because of her Jewish background. Hans Coper learned the potter’s craft in her workshop on Albion Mews Street in London. Although Lucie Rie was twenty years older and had both excellent training and many years of experience, she did not view Hans Coper as an apprentice or trainee, but al",

Weltkrieg die Studiokeramik in Großbritannien maßgeblich mitgeprägt. Die Rede ist von Lucie Rie und Hans Coper. Ihre Arbeiten sind vom 18. März bis zum 6. April in Höhr-Grenzhausen zu sehen. Hans Coper wurde am 8. April 1920 in Chemnitz geboren. Sein Vater Julius Coper war ein erfolgreicher Textilunternehmer. Hans und sein fünf Jahre älterer Bruder Walter wuchsen in einem großbürgerlichen Milieu auf. Nach der Machtergreifung 1933 verboten die Nazis dem jüdischen Julius Coper die Erwerbstätigkeit. Um seine nicht-jüdische Frau Erna zu schützen oder auch aus Verzweiflung brachte Julius Coper sich im Juni 1936 um. Sein Sohn Walter emigrierte 1937 nach Argentinien. Hans versteckte sich sechs Monate in Wiesbaden und ging dann nach England. Deutschland besuchte er nie wieder. Im Mai 1940 wurde Hans Coper in England als Flüchtling festgenommen und mit Vertriebenen und Kriegsgefangenen in ein kanadisches Internierungskamp verschifft. Dort lernte er Fritz Wolf, einen Künstler aus Breslau, kennen. Bei ihren Gesprächen wuchst in Hans Coper der Wunsch, Bildhauer zu werden. Durch eine Anmeldung bei dem Pioneer Corps, einer Einheit, die Bau- und Nachschubtätigkeiten für die British Army ausführte, konnte er das Kamp verlassen und kehrte wieder nach England zurück. Hans Coper bei Lucie Rie in der Werkstatt 1943 wurde er vom Dienst befreit und schlug sich mit Gelegenheitsjobs durch.

    "biography": "The fourth edition of the Loewe Foundation Craft Prize presents an exciting array of objects that prove a mastery of material, reimagine traditional techniques and display a brave willingness to experiment. Many of the artists chosen this year use found and upcycled materials in their work, and concern for the natural world expressed through organic forms is an omnipresent theme. The finalists, hailing from 6 continents and 18 different countries, range from recently graduated and newly emerging artists to well-known names and esteemed leaders in their fields. This year’s finalists were chosen by a panel of experts from 2,920 total submissions – a 15% increase since last year – by artisans representing 107 countries. Glass object of finalist 2020 Jessica Loughlin, Australia. The Craft Prize 2020 recognises the shortlisted artists as having made fundamentally important contributions to the development of contemporary craft. The legacy of the exhibition will be documented by a catalogue containing each of the finalists’ pieces. The annual prize was launched by the Loewe Foundation in 2016 to celebrate excellence, artistic merit and newness in modern craftsmanship. The award, which was conceived by creative director Jonathan Anderson, aims to acknowledge the importance of craft in today’s culture and recognise working artists whose talent, vision and will to innovate promise to set a new standard for the future. The prize was conceived as a tribute to Loewe’s beginnings as a collective craft workshop in 1846. Jonathan Anderson stated at the award’s inception: ‘Craft is the essence of Loewe. As a house, we are about craft in the purest sense of the word. That is where our modernity lies, and it will always be relevant.’ For the 2020 edition, a panel of 10 experts convened in Madrid for two days to review all the entries to the prize and select the shortlist. In their deliberations, the panel sought to identify the most outstanding works in terms of technical accomplishm",

Sie sollte vom 11. bis 15. März 2020 stattfinden. Hintergrund für die Absage ist die Verbreitung des Coronavirus/Covid-19 und die damit einhergehende, dringende Empfehlung des Krisenstabs der Bayerischen Staatsregierung, große, internationale Messen bis auf Weiteres abzusagen oder zu verschieben. Während die Mailänder Möbelmesse auf den Zeitraum vom 16. bis 21. Juni verschoben wurde, soll die nächste Internationale Handwerksmesse mit Handwerk &amp; Design und Garten München erst ein Jahr später vom 10. bis 14. März 2021 stattfinden. Diese Ringe von Jordan Furze mit dem Titel Nation Divded [gespaltene Nation], sollten auf der Sonderschau Talente im Rahmen der „Handwerk&amp;Design“ in München zu sehen sein. Der Zentralverband des Deutschen Handwerks (ZDH), der Bayerische Handwerkstag und die Handwerkskammer für München und Oberbayern, Gesellschafter des Messeveranstalters GHM, befürworten die Empfehlung des Krisenstabs der Bayerischen Staatsregierung und stellen das Wohl von Ausstellern und Besuchern an oberste Stelle. Dazu Dieter Dohr, Vorsitzender Geschäftsführer der Gesellschaft für Handwerksmessen mbH: „Angesichts der Verbreitung des Coronavirus ist die Absage der Internationalen Handwerksmesse als Großveranstaltung mit 1.000 Ausstellern und über 100.000 erwarteten Besuchern sowie einer entsprechend hohen Anzahl an persönlichen Kontakten unumgänglich. Wir hoffen auf das Verständnis aller Messeteilnehmer. Das Messeziel eines vielfältigen persönlichen Austausches zur Pflege und zum Aufbau von Geschäftsbeziehungen ist unter den gegebenen Umständen nicht mehr risikofrei umsetzbar.“ Ausgenommen von der Absage aufgrund höherer Gewalt sind die handwerkspolitischen Begleitveranstaltungen wie die Vollversammlung des Zentralverbandes des Deutschen Handwerks.

    "biography": "This is the first time that pieces by the internationally renowned jewelry artist are being shown in Munich. Born in 1949, she was the first Western student to complete kumihimo training in Japan. Kumihimo is an ancient Japanese braiding technique used to make elaborate, patterned silk cords. Martin practices this art, which requires the utmost precision, with wafer-thin wires of fine gold and platinum. The meditative process results in delicate weaves and elegant patterns. She devoted herself entirely to the evolution of this technique while studying at the Royal College of Art in London from 1992 to 1994. Anhänger Blütenblätter, [Pendant of Petals], 2019. Gold, platinum, moonstone. Photo James Champion. Paper earrings, 2018. Gold and platinum. Photo James Champion. While searching for clasps or pins for her precious metal braids, Martin became aware of the young German goldsmith Dorle Pätzold, who was one of her fellow students at the Royal College of Art. The two artists have worked as a team ever since. Numerous imaginative necklaces, pendants, brooches and earrings have been created on the basis of the kumihimo technique during the past 25 years. The design and the braid are by Catherine Martin; afterwards Dorle Pätzold further processes the pieces and makes them wearable. Commenting on her work with gold, Marti says: “I love the color and sensuality but above all the timelessness … the thought of continuing a tradition of using this beautiful material which has been used for adornment for centuries.” Earrings of five leaves, gold and platinum, 2019. Photo James Champion. Brigitte Scheytt, who has been fascinated by Martin’s work for many years, asked Dorle Pätzold to curate the exhibition. The goldsmith has worked on a freelance basis for the Scheytt siblings since the opening of their gallery in 2016. She is also successfully represented with her own jewelry creations at Gallery Scheytt. Catherine Martin will be present at the vernissage, where she will give ",

    "biography": "Circa 1,000 exhibitors present jewelry, watches, precious stones, semi-finished products and technical equipment at Inhorgenta Munich in 2020. This is a remarkable feat for Munich Trade Fair because the heyday of these industries has long passed in Germany, where the jewelry and watch trade nonetheless remains a socially significant and lucrative market segment valued at circa 4.5 billion euros. Especially against the background of e-commerce, specialized shops and galleries for jewelry and watches are an important factor for the stationary retail trade as well as for the much-discussed and jeopardized survival of city centers. Hall C2 has a new sustainable concept in 2020. A “Trend Factory” there hosts discussions of topics related to the future. What underlies these efforts? Hall C2 has been the meeting place for contemporary jewelry design since 1998, when Munich Trade Fair relocated from Theresienwiese to the modern exhibition center in Riem. Hall C2’s most important features are individualistic, creative styles shaped by the personalities of the designers as well as independent, holistic production in workshops or manufactories. Several larger ones of this kind can also be found in Hall B1. The new designers acquired their expertise through practical training coupled with studies at technical colleges and universities. Their creations combine traditional craftsmanship with modern product design and innovative technologies. Last but not least, these articles embody a humane, contemporary alternative to conventional, industrially fabricated jewelry and especially to mass-produced goods from low-wage countries. It is praiseworthy that Munich Trade Fair Center is making an effort to keep Hall C2 alive, but it would be even more important if the trade were to play its part by briskly purchasing the items on display there.

Twenty successful themes will be on display in Munich for the upcoming 50th anniversary show. This work by Robert Race is called “Ready for Almost Anything”.

Both men will participate in Exempla in 2020. The glass artist Florian Lechner first took part in Exempla in 1977. Born in Munich, Lechner has worked with light, sound and movement since 1968 and uses the fusing technique. The British toy maker Robert Race crafts kinetic sculptures from driftwood in his workshop in Bradford on Avon. He was in Munich for the Exempla theme “World of Wood” in 2002. Stefano Marchetti from Padua participated in the “Universe of Metals” at Exempla in 2005. His jewelry is reminiscent of Byzantine and Renaissance works. Marchetti uses techniques such as shibuichi or mokumé-gane, which he has refined and developed over the last decade and a half.

    "biography": "It is as sensational today as it was in 2002, when the Free State of Bavaria opened a modern art museum in Munich, following in the footsteps of Nuremberg, which had opened one two years earlier. Visitors can experience outstanding design side by side with fine art. The concept’s realization is largely due to the art historian and museologue Florian Hufnagl. Born in Munich, Hufnagl died there on December 31, 2019 at the age of 71 after a long and serious illness. Florian Hufnagl led Die Neue Sammlung – The Design Museum in Munich to outstanding success. Photo: Hannes Magerstädt. He was not famous except among his colleagues. Nor was he a celebrity curator or someone who basked in the limelight. But his presence could not be overlooked. A surprisingly agile mover and shaper, a strategist and a thoughtful analyst, he reached the peak of his personal Mount Everest when the Pinakothek der Moderne opened in 2002, after having already climbed to the summit of Nanga Parbat with the opening of the Neues Museum in Nuremberg in 2000. Hufnagl was one of the first experts in Germany who sought to establish design as an academic subject for art history. He pursued this goal via practical means as a lecturer at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. As honorary professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, he was eager to see design and the applied arts given equal importance as the so-called “free” or “fine” arts. Hufnagl’s vehicle was Die Neue Sammlung, the State Museum of Applied Arts (now The Design Museum) in Munich, which he led as director from 1990 onwards, but which he had already been jointly responsible for as curator since 1980. After many years as an exhibition organizer and “estate hunter” for the architectural collection of the Technical University of Munich, as a volunteer at the Bavarian State Office for the Preservation of Monuments and as a freelance art historian, Hufnagl became curator of Die Neue Sammlung in 1980. He seized this chance to realize his ide",

    "biography": "Bis heute ist es eine Sensation, dass der Freistaat Bayern 2002 in München – wie zwei Jahre zuvor in Nürnberg – ein Museum der Moderne eröffnete, in dem Design Seite an Seite mit Kunst zu erleben ist. Die Durchsetzung der Konzeption ist in erheblichem Maße dem Kunsthistoriker und Museumsmann Florian Hufnagl zu verdanken. Der gebürtige Münchner starb am 31. Dezember 2019 nach langer schwerer Krankheit im Alter von 71 Jahren in seiner Heimatstadt. Florian Hufnagl führte die Neue Sammlung – The Design Museum, München, zu einem überragenden Erfolg. Foto Hannes Magerstädt. Kein Berühmter außerhalb der Fachwelt, kein Starkurator und keiner, der im Vordergrund stand – obwohl seine Präsenz nicht zu übersehen war. Aber ein Beweger. Überraschend leichtfüßig. Ein Stratege und sorgfältig denkender Analytiker. Auf seinem Mount Everest stand er 2002, als die Pinakothek der Moderne eröffnet wurde. Den Nanga Parbat hatte er 2000 mit Eröffnung des Neuen Museums in Nürnberg erreicht. Als einer der ersten in Deutschland kämpfte Florian Hufnagl darum, Design als wissenschaftlichen Gegenstand in der Kunstgeschichte zu etablieren. Dies tat er praxisnah als Dozent an der Ludwig Maximilians Universität München. Als Honorarprofessor an der Münchner Kunstakademie ging es ihm ebenfalls darum, dem Design und den angewandten Künsten das gleiche Gewicht zu verschaffen wie der sogenannten „Freien“ Kunst. Hufnagls Vehikel war Die Neue Sammlung, das Staatliche Museum für angewandte Kunst (heute: The Design Museum) in München, das er von 1990 an als Direktor leitete, aber bereits seit 1980 als Konservator mit verantwortet hatte. Nach Jahren als Ausstellungsmacher und „Nachlaßschleicher“ zugunsten der Architektursammlung der Technischen Universität München, als Volontär am Bayerischen Landesamt für Denkmalpflege und als freier Kunsthistoriker konnte er 1980 als Museumskonservator an Die Neue Sammlung gehen.

    "biography": "This year’s special show “Jewelry” received 802 applications, from which Curator Chequita Nahar, who is also a jewelry artist and dean of the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Maastricht, selected 63 jewelry artists from 29 countries. Current pieces by these artists will be on displayed at the “Handwerk &amp; Design” show from March 11 to 15, 2020 at Munich Trade Fair Centre. Wolfgang Lösche from the Chamber of Skilled Crafts in Munich and Upper Bavaria views the strong interest shown by applicants from 61 countries as proof of the global significance of this contemporary jewelry show. The spectrum for 2020 will be especially interesting because works by well-known and very well-known jewelry makers will be juxtaposed with pieces created by their next-generation colleagues. Participant in the special jewelry 2020 show “Schmuck 2020”. Paul Adie, Great Britain, “Home“ ring, 2019. Aluminium, silver, paint, 8 x 3 x 5 cm. Chequita Nahar’s selection presents many different positions: classical metalworking, references to fashion, poetic approaches, depictions of animals, eroticism, painting, enamel and a variety of surprisingly humorous, satirical, colorful, earnest and conceptual jewelry. Artists from Germany are most strongly represented, followed by colleagues from Korea and Holland, and to a lesser but nonetheless strong extent by artists from Australia and Czech Republic. The three Herbert Hofmann Prizes will be awarded on March 14th, the Saturday of the fair, at 5 p.m. “Jewelry 2020” will honor the Australian artist Robert Baines as a “modern classic.” Professor emeritus of RMIT University, Melbourne, Baines was awarded the title “Living Treasure” by his home country Australia.

    "biography": "The unity of craftsmanship and art that had been proclaimed in the Bauhaus Manifesto was lost during the course of Modernism in the Western world, but this separation never occurred in Japan. Nonetheless, a few contemporary Western artists harmonize craftsmanship and spirituality, matter and spirit in an exemplary manner. The Swiss metalworker Andreas Caderas, who is passionately devoted to the arts of forging and working with metal, is a good example. Born in Basel in 1955, Caderas initially apprenticed as a goldsmith. At age 18, a Japanese sword sparked his interest in traditional Japanese metalworking and Japanese craftsmanship. He tirelessly deepened his expertise and further developed his techniques. For example, at the age of 43, he studied iron forging in Mühleberg, Switzerland. In Eastern thought and especially in the traditional Japanese folk art Mingei, the truth and beauty of handcrafted artifacts emerge analogously to their counterparts in natural objects, i.e. their genesis is similar to the mysterious processes of nature. Andreas Caderas has oriented his work according to this attitude. In meditative tranquility and with the utmost precision, he uses a repeatedly practiced and internalized artisanal technique or intuitively allows his feelings to flow into an object, “from my innermost sensibility, unintentionally and uncensored” as he says. Andreas Mathias Caderas, two vases, 2016 and 2019. Old Japanese bamboo, silver inserts, signed: A C B S, bat seal, height 32 and 33 cm, Ø 7.5–7.6 cm. © Japan Art &#8211; Galerie Friedrich Müller. Caderas has devoted himself for approximately ten years to the theme of vases and canisters of bamboo with silver inserts. Like his cast and forged fruit and animal shapes, they pay homage to nature’s beauty and symbolism. The 60- to 80-year-old bamboo with its warm, honey-colored patina comes from Japan. Its circular growth nodes, which appear at different heights in the objects, are a distinctive element in the design. C",

    "biography": "Während im Westen im Verlauf der Moderne die noch im Bauhaus-Manifest propagierte Einheit von Handwerk und Kunst verlorenging, hat es diese Trennung in Japan nie gegeben. Doch auch bei uns gibt es Künstler, die in vorbildlicher Weise handwerkliches Können und Spiritualität, Materie und Geist in Einklang bringen. Der Schweizer Andreas Caderas mit seiner leidenschaftlichen Hingabe an die Schmiede- und Metallkunst ist ein Beispiel. 1955 in Basel geboren erlernte er zunächst das Goldschmiedehandwerk. Mit 18 weckte ein japanisches Schwert sein Interesse an der traditonellen japanischen Metallverarbeitung sowie der Handwerkskunst Japans. Unermüdlich vertiefte Caderas sein Wissen und entwickelte seine Techniken weiter. So studierte er noch im Alter von 43 Jahren das Schmieden von Eisen im schweizerischen Mühleberg. Im östlichen Denken und ganz besonders in der traditionellen japanischen Volkskunst Mingei entstehen Wahrheit und Schönheit handwerklicher Dinge analog zum natürlich Seienden, das heißt, ähnlich wie in der Natur mit ihren geheimnisvollen Prozessen. Andreas Caderas hat sich in seinem Schaffen daran orientiert. In meditativer Ruhe wendet er eine immer wieder geübte und verinnerlichte handwerkliche Technik in höchster Präzision an oder lässt rein intuitiv seine Gefühle in ein Objekt miteinfließen, „absichtslos und unzensiert aus meinem innersten Empfinden“, wie er sagt. Ein Thema, dem sich Caderas seit rund zehn Jahren widmet, sind Vasen und Dosen aus Bambus mit Einsätzen aus Silber. Wie seine gegossenen und geschmiedeten Frucht- und Tierformen sind sie eine Hommage an die Natur, an ihre Schönheit und Symbolik. Der 60 bis 80 Jahre alte Bambus mit seiner warmen, honigfarbenen Patina stammt aus Japan. Ein prägnantes Gestaltungselement ist der kreisförmige Wachstumsknoten, der in den Objekten in unterschiedlicher Höhe erscheint. Veränderungen der Oberfläche werden nicht kaschiert, sondern bewusst akzentuiert. So stabilisiert Caderas Risse mal mit Klammern aus geschwär",

    "biography": "The exhibition “Take Place” aims to go beyond the usual bound that separates the artist and the performer from the public, and invite the public to participate in the artist’s experience and to the artist’s point of view. As a response to “Institut für Alles Mögliche”, “Take Place I” fills the 20 square meter gallery space with artists. Presented through the window wall towards the street, the work consists of live encounters between people, while the material is the artists or the artists’ presence. During the opening hours, street passengers and visitors are welcome to come into the gallery. Once they enter the gallery, the audiences become parts of the work. With artists standing, sitting and chatting in the space, the work erases the difference between the artists and visitors, and questions the general expectations towards an exhibition. It exists as a performance, an interaction, and an immaterial experience. In Take Place II, a group of artists sit on three rows of stadium seats inside the gallery facing the window, and stare at the street through the entire opening hours. Rather than being observed, the work is observing whatever is happening outside the gallery and creating an unfamiliar situation for both the artists and the viewers. And the work itself is held in the moments of these encounters. Through these encounters, the work challenges the viewers’ as well as the artists’ roles and participations in a work and in an exhibition, blurring the lines between the making, presenting, and experiencing of an art piece. The Institut für Alles Mögliche is an artistic project that sets about questioning, scrutinising and probing the institutionalisation and presentation of contemporary art.The central concept is to develop spaces of possibility in which exchange and experiences can take place. The project can be understood as an organism, as an artistic attempt to find niches and to implant a non-commercial program into the commercial structure of the municipal",

Bei dem Projekt, das in zwei Aktionen stattfindet, kann jeder Besucher und jede Besucherin an den Erfahrungen der Künstler:innen und ihrer Sichtweise teilnehmen. Bei „Take Place I“ wird der 20 Quadratmeter große Galerieraum mit Künstler:innen gefüllt. Präsentiert durch die Fensterwand in Richtung Straße besteht die Arbeit aus Begegnungen zwischen Menschen. Ausgangsmaterial sind die anwesenden Künstler:innen. Während der Öffnungszeiten sind Passant:innen wie Besucher:innen herzlich eingeladen, die Galerie zu betreten. Wer in der Galerie ist, wird Teil der Arbeit. Indem die Künstler:innen im Raum stehen, sitzen und plaudern, heben sie den Unterschied zwischen sich und den Besucher:innen auf und hinterfragen die allgemeinen Erwartungen an eine Ausstellung. Das ganze ist eine Performance, eine Interaktion und eine immaterielle Erfahrung und versteht sich als Antwort auf die Zielsetzung des „Instituts für Alles Mögliche“. Bei „Take Place II“ sitzt eine Gruppe von Künstler:innen auf drei Reihen von Stadionsitzen in der Galerie, die dem Fenster zugewandt sind. Während der gesamten Öffnungszeiten blicken sie auf die Straße. Anstatt beobachtet zu werden, beobachtet das menschliche Kunstwerk, was außerhalb der Galerie geschieht, und schafft eine ungewohnte Situation für die Künstler:innen ebenso wie für die Betrachter:innen. Die Arbeit selbst findet in den Momenten dieser Begegnungen statt. Sie fordert beide Seiten heraus und verwischt die Grenzen zwischen Herstellen, Präsentieren und Erleben eines Kunstwerks. Das „Institut für Alles Mögliche“ ist ein künstlerisches Projekt, bei dem es darum geht, die Institutionalisierung und Präsentation zeitgenössischer Kunst zu hinterfragen und zu erproben.

    "biography": "Born in Malmö, Sweden in 1894, Hannah Ryggen (née Jönsson) was not only an unusual weaver and artist. Today one would say that she was also a political activist. Trained as a teacher, she started teaching at a Swedish primary school in 1912. She began taking evening classes in Lund in southern Sweden in 1916 with the painter Fredrik Krebs, from whom she continued to learn the basics of academic painting for the following six years. Hannah Jönsson traveled to Dresden in 1922 to study the art collection at the Old Masters Picture Gallery for several months. She then continued to Munich, where she studied the artworks on display in the Alte Pinakothek. This was also when she met the Norwegian painter Hans Ryggen. After her return to Malmö, she gave up painting and devoted herself to weaving.

The couple relocated to the Norwegian coastal region of Ørlandet in 1923, where her daughter Mona was born that same year. The mostly self-sufficient family lived for many years in a house that they had built themselves with neither running water nor electricity. But the hardships and difficulties of life in the countryside did not stop Hannah Ryggen from creating an impressive oeuvre with her monumental tapestries. Her woven pictures deal primarily with the events and political conflicts in Europe in the 1930s and Forties. But also after 1945, her political dedication through the medium of weaving art did not cease. In a tapestry woven in 1962, 72",

    "biography": "Die 1894 in Malmö, Schweden, zur Welt gekommene Hannah Ryggen, geborene Jönsson, war nicht nur eine ungewöhnliche Weberin und Künstlerin. Heute würde man sagen, sie war auch eine politische Aktivistin. Zur Lehrerin ausgebildet unterrichtet sie ab 1912 an einer schwedischen Grundschule. Ab 1916 nimmt sie im südschwedischen Lund Abendunterricht bei dem Maler Fredrik Krebs und erlernt sechs Jahre lang die Grundlagen akademischer Malerei. 1922 reist Hannah Jönsson reist nach Dresden und studiert dort einige Monate die Kunstsammlung der Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister sowie in München die Werke der Alten Pinakothek. Dabei lernt sie den norwegischen Maler Hans Ryggen kennen. Nach ihrer Rückkehr nach Malmö gibt sie das Malen auf und widmet sich dem Weben. Hannah Ryggen, Drømmedød (Tod der Träume), 1936, Bildteppich aus Wolle und Leinen, 235 x 273 cm, Nordenfjeldske Kunstindustrimuseum (Nationales Museum für Kunsthandwerk und Design), Trondheim © H. Ryggen, VG Bild-Kunst, Bonn 2019. Photo: Anders Sundet Solberg. Nach ihrer Heirat mit Hans Ryggen 1923 zieht Hannah Ryggen ein Jahr später in die norwegische Küstenregion Ørlandet. Im gleichen Jahre 1924 bringt sie ihre Tochter Mona zur Welt. Viele Jahre lebt die Familie im selbstgebauten Haus ohne fließendes Wasser und Strom und versorgt sich weitgehend autark. Das entbehrungsreiche, harte Leben auf dem Land hält Hannah Ryggen nicht davon ab, mit ihren monumentalen Wandteppichen ein eindrucksvolles Werk zu schaffen. In ihren gewebten Bilder befasst sich die Künstlerin vor allem mit den Ereignissen und politischen Auseinandersetzungen im Europa der 1930er- und 1940er-Jahre. Doch auch nach 1945 erlöschte ihr politisches Engagement mit den Mitteln ihrer Webkunst nicht. So kritisiert Hannah Ryggen in einem Wandteppich von 1962 noch im Alter von 72 Jahren den Krieg der Amerikaner in Vietnam. „In einer Gegenwart, die von zunehmender Ungleichheit, Nationalismus und Populismus geprägt ist, zeugen ihre Werke von erschütternder Aktualität“ h",

    "biography": "It is not uncommon for a subtle inner connection to reveal itself only in the juxtaposition of two seemingly dissimilar artworks. An example can be seen in the exhibit by Chiyoko Tanaka and Yasuhisa Kohyama at Japan Art, which is on display until December 14, 2019. With freely constructed vases which he fires in an anagama kiln [a single-chamber kiln for Japanese wood-fired ceramics] that he built himself, Yasuhisa Kohyama has long ranked among his nation’s most important artists. The artistic kinship between this ceramist, who was born in Shigaraki in 1936, and the five-year-younger textile artist is rooted in the traditions of a country that never strictly separated utilitarian crafts from fine arts as in the West, and in both artists’ sensitive inclusion of the phenomena of nature and time. While textile wall objects by Chiyoko Tanaka show openness toward contemporary Western art, Yasuhisa Kohyama’s work largely derives from the rich art tradition of his homeland.

Photo Japan Art, Frankfurt. Deborah Klochko, director of the Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego, suggests that the ceramist’s works should be evaluated “in comparison to monumental natural wonders such as Uluru in Australia or Antelope Canyon in the American Southwest.” Klochko adds that we feel connected to these places by the selfsame power and emotional resonance that we can experience in Kohyama’s ceramics. The heartbeat of the earth, she says, is palpably present in these artworks…. Klochko began her text on Yasuhisa Kohyama with a quote from the American mythologist Joseph Campell: “The goal of life is to make your heartbeat match the beat of the universe, to match your nature with Nature.” It is not only the natural colors of the ceramics themselves and their sculptural forms, partly created by cut",

The producers’ gallery and atelier collective “noon.schmuck und product” [jewelry and products] was set up on Dresdener Strasse 26 in Berlin’s Kreuzberg district in 2009. Since 2012, the team has been composed of Ursula Bonderer, Elgin Fischer, Monika Glöss, Ulrike Poelk and Julia Reymann. Each of “noon’s” designers has embraced her own concept, and has further developed it over the course of many years. Thus they continuously create innovative jewelry and other products that they showcase in the brightly lit, unostentatiously designed gallery located not far from Oranienplatz Square. “We attach major importance to creating alternatives to conventional jewelry, featuring unusual materials, shapes and styles of wearing,” is their credo. Ursula Bonderer, for example, creates her jewelry using rubber and precious metals, imaginatively transmuting flat surfaces into three-dimensional entities. Elgin Fischer specializes in playfully incorporating colored enamel. Monika Glöss crafts minimalist, clear-cut pieces that have something unexpectedly playful about them thanks to sophisticated technical details. Ulrike Poelk’s jewelry is compellingly variable, offering surprisingly simple options for multiple styles of wearing. Julia Reyman combines filigree wire bodies with Japanese Washi paper to create complex three-dimensional pieces. Ursula Bonderer, splash earrings. EPDM laser cut. Photo Mathias Zuppiger Zürich.

To mark the gallery’s 10th anniversary, “noon’s” five designers take a chance with “a slightly more intimate exhibition concept.” Each of them invited two of their favorite jewelry or product designers to showcase their creations at the anniversary exhibition entitled “affinities”.

    "biography": "The annual Craft Prize of the Loewe Foundation is valued at 50,000 euros, which makes this award larger than any other national or international competition in the field of craftsmanship. Alongside outstanding craftsmanship, the jurors also seek artistic vision and willingness to innovate. The aim is to set new standards for the future of craftsmanship. The invitation to tender for the fourth edition in 2020, which ends on October 30, states: “The Loewe Craft Prize seeks to acknowledge and support international artisans of any age (over 18) or gender who demonstrate an exceptional ability to create objects of superior aesthetic value. By identifying work that reinterprets existing knowledge to make it relevant today while reflecting its maker’s personal language and distinct hand, the Loewe Foundation aims to highlight the continuing contribution of craft to the culture of our time.” All entries should – fall within an area of applied arts, such as ceramics, bookbinding, enamelwork, jewelry, lacquer, metal, furniture, leather, textiles, glass, paper, wood, etc. – be an original work, handmade or partly handmade – have been created in the last five years – be one-of a-kind – have won no prizes previously – demonstrate artistic intent. What strategies have led to success thus far Looking at the work of the three previous first-prize winners, it becomes clear that very different qualities led to success in the past. The first winner in 2017 was the wood turner and artist Ernst Gamperl with his wooden object “Tree of Life 2.” The jury’s chairman Anatxu Zabalbeascoa commented on the decision by saying that it was motivated by “the way in which this work explores the meeting point between formal values and a social message. This is an object that is both beautiful, and teaches us the value of recycling. It is based on rescuing fallen trees and bringing nature back to life with exquisite skill.” The impressive dimensions of the objects may have played a consequential role ",

    "biography": "Inspired by her conviction that art is vital to life, Angelika Metzger founded her gallery in Johannesberg near Aschaffenburg in 1996. The focus is on ceramics ranging from artistically designed vessels to sculptural artworks. The show “GefäßErweiterung” [Vessel Expansion] includes classic names in German studio ceramics such as Beate Kuhn, Karl and Ursula Scheid or Gerald and Gotlind Weigel; renowned international artists such as Arnold Annen, Jean-François Thiérion, Xavier Toubes, Julian Stair and Rachel Wood; and sought-after up-and-coming stars such as Mimi Joung and Johannes Nagel. What all have in common, says Angelika Metzger, is that they “developed the vessel in different ways in the direction of a free, non-functional object.” The following text, which she wrote for her “Vascular Dilation” exhibition, explains the important role that ceramic art plays in the Metzger’s daily life. Vessel of the French ceramist Brigitte Penicaud, 56 x 46 x 10 cm, ceramics. “I love the vessels in our home. Some I use regularly, others I bought only because of their unconventionality. It’s a pleasure to choose one or another cup or mug for my morning coffee. Do I want the cup warm my hands today or should it simply be crowned with milk foam? Bowls and vases likewise enrich my everyday life, each in its own special way. Vessels have been essential parts of cultural history for millennia, so it’s not surprising that anatomical terms such as “foot,” “belly,” “shoulder” and “neck” are used to describe the shapes and parts of vessels. Vessels were used to store supplies, for safekeeping of sacrificial offerings, to keep foods cool and to transport them. Nowadays they’re most often used at mealtimes or as containers for plants. From earliest cultures to the present day, the makers of vessels tried and try to unite usefulness and beauty. The urge to create something sublime can be traced to prehistoric times.

The second prize and 6,000 euros went to Jesse Magee, an American who lives in Höhr-Grenzhausen. The City of Höhr-Grenzhausen’s Salt-Fired Ceramics Award was divided between the local ceramist Monika Debus and Franz Juliens from Ludwigshafen, who each received 5,000 euros. Hyujin Kim from Korea won the Young Talent Award. The Westerwald Awards, which have been calling for entries from all over Europe since 1999, were conferred for the 14thtime in 2019. 425 entrants had submitted their applications via the internet. The jurors included the Managing Director of the Westerwald Museums, Helga Gerhardus, the Director of the Ceramics Museum, Nele van Wieringen, the art historian, former gallerist and collector Jörg Johnen from Berlin, the museum curator Sabine Runde from Frankfurt, as well as the ceramists Julian Stair from London and Xavier Toubes from Chicago. 74 works created by 48 artists had made it onto the short list.

Topsoil from Neuwied, fired at 1200 ͦC, each 85x100x120cm. The exhibition is not intended to provide an exemplary overall picture of artistically created ceramics in Europe, but to mirror some essential developments, explained Nele van Wieringen. As regards the award winner, Johannes Nagel, this refers to his transforming a ceramic vessel, which is still recognizable as such in many of his works, into freeform sculpture. The winner of the second prize, Jesse Magee, fired unpurified topsoil from Neuwied in the shape of individual blocks. The jurors were quoted as having specifically decided to confer the Freeform Ceramics Awards to creations that are much more than merely haphazard results or process-driven. “Post-firing finishing makes for a fragile, aesthetically appealing balance.",

Fortunately, this is not evident in her ceramics. The “Bilderbögen” is a small catalogue. As always brilliantly photographed by ad lumina Ralph Ziegler, it contains pictures of her ceramics of the past year in large images against a dark gray background. Nearly 70 objects will shown in the exhibition, which takes place at the artist’s home in the winemaking town of Deidesheim from September 7 to 22,2019. The 44-page catalogue presents 33 works, i.e. almost half of the objects on display. For her glazes, Lotte Reimers often uses ashlars, copper carbonate or malachite, as well as ashes of wood from trees and shrubs from different regions. Photo: Miriam Künzli. Jar with “ruff” on an oval base. Glazed with manganese ore, kaolin, elm ash, copper carbonate; H 18.9 cm. All object photos: ad Lumina, Ralf Ziegler. Jar with two “curling” rings. Glazed with manganese ore, copper carbonate, ashes of tobacco and vines; H 22 cm. As Lotte Reimers reveals in the foreword, she used not only lightly speckled or coarser, light brownish fireclay, but also finer, almost white material containing fireclay. In the “battalion” of her ceramics of the past decades, the artist sees “familiar formal accents appearing again in 2018 as if from wafts of mist, as well as new forms such as the ‘neck ruffs,’ single or multiple, on the neck or as a waist constriction.” Tall cylindrical shape on an oval base.

    "biography": "The exhibition in Direktorenhaus is intended to show “the important role that today’s handicrafts play in plans for society’s future.” The spectrum ranges from jewelry art to ceramic installations that fill entire rooms. Also on display are skills that are threatened with extinction, “as well as some of the most coveted examples of European design,” according to the organizers in Berlin. A number of rooms that were previously closed to the public will be used for the exhibition. Curator Pascal Johanssen with seating by Martin Holzapfel. © Philipp Haas. Pascal Johanssen and Katja Kleiss developed the concept of Direktorenhaus. The historic building on the River Spree in Berlin-Mitte has served since 2010 as a gallery for arts, crafts and design, while simultaneously functioning as center for art and culture. In a press release about the Radical Craft exhibition, the organizers write: “The projects of Direktorenhaus oscillate between creative experiments, new materials, designs for society’s future and artistic design. Basically, it is also about the question of the significance of contemporary craftsmanship in plans for society’s future.” Vases from “Aufgabe Null”.

The annual exhibition, which is curated by Pascal Johanssen, clearly shows “that a fundamental separation between designers and craftspeople scarcely exists.” The difference between design and craftsmanship lies in the way of thinking, between conservative personalities on the one hand and innovative personalities on the other. “Designers and craftspeople alike participate through their creations in the ongoing debate about consumption and the turnaround in prosperity. They create products that can be experienced sensually and whose value does not diminish, but increases with each passing year because the products per se are imbued with depth and endurin",

    "biography": "Agde is situated near Montpellier in the Languedoc-Roussillon region in the South of France. This coastal town in the estuary of the Hérault river was founded in 550 BC with the name Agathe Tyche, which means “good fortune”. The Canal du Midi with its unique, round locks traverses the northern part of the historic town. The canal has enjoyed protected status as a Unesco World Heritage site since 1996. Due to sedimentation, the Old Town is now located four kilometres inland. The town has been reconnected to Mediterranean Sea by the development of the Cap d’Agde, a popular tourist resort with a marina and man-made lagoon. The Cap d´Agde naturist resort is one of the largest in Europe. In d&#8217;Agde, southern France, sponsored artists&#8217; workshops and a gallery enliven the city center. © Nadia Jaafar. Agde, which now has nearly 30,000 inhabitants, has a distinguished history. Founded by Greeks from Massalia (now Marseille), it was then taken over by the Romans in 49 BC. A bishopric was established in Agde in the 5th century AD, and its first bishop was martyred. The Visigoths conquered the town in 475, followed by the Alamanni in around the year 500. The Saracens took their turn in 725, and Karl Martell laid waste to the town in 737. The construction of the still much admired Saint-Etienne Cathedral began in 872 and was completed in 1453. Agde’s many buildings that are worth a visit include the Mont-Saint-Loup lighthouse, the Art Deco Chateau Laurens, and numerous historic sites of interest.

    "biography": "The number of submissions alone – 2,500 this year – shows the strong attraction of the Spanish Loewe Foundation’s Craft Prize, which is now in the third year of its existence. The large international jury of architects, designers, museum curators, representatives of institutions and trade journalists is unparalleled. Wolfgang Lösche from the Chamber of Crafts in Munich and Upper Bavaria was involved from Germany. Other jurors included the British ceramic artist Jennifer Lee, who won the award in 2018. Enrique Loewe (Honorary President of the Loewe Foundation) and Jonathan Anderson (Creative Director of Loewe) represented the organizer. Twenty-nine finalists remained after the pre-selection. Genta Ishizuka, the overall winner, was born in 1982 in Kyoto, where he now lives and works after having spent time at Royal College in London. Jonathan Anderson, Loewe creative director, commented on this year’s winner: “Ishizuka’s work proves that craft can be open and shows the freedom of creation. His use of an ancient lacquer technique in a contemporary form breaks conventions and represents a new sculptural vision in craft.” The Jury also agreed upon two special mentions. Harry Morgan for the work “Untitled” from Dichotomy Series, 2018 and Kazuhito Takadoi for the work KADO (Angle), 2018. From the 26 June to 22 July, Genta Ishizuka’s winning piece and all the finalists’ works will be showcased at a free exhibition at Isamu Noguchi’s indoor stone garden “Heaven” inside the Sogetsu Kaikan building in Tokyo. From ceramics, furniture and glassware, to basketry, jewellery and blacksmithing, the show demonstrates the artists’ quests to reconcile the ancient with the avant-garde. A video on the Loewe Craft Prize website gives an insight into the exhibition. First Prize: Genta Ishizuka, Japan, Surface Tactility #11. Urushi, styrene foam balls, 2 way tricot, linen cloth.

    "biography": "More than in perhaps any other country in the world, the ceramic art is deeply linked to Japanese culture and is still highly valued today, e.g. in the tea ceremony. Masamichi Yoshikawa numbers among the artists who have dedicated themselves to the renewal of the ceramic art. He earned international renown primarily with his sculptural, architectural, porcelain objects, which are usually composed of porcelain cubes or plates of various thicknesses with minor irregularities expressing the philosophy that genuine beauty manifests itself only through imperfection. Yoshikawa uses flowing and often dripping sehakujiglaze to create an additional level of visual and tactile tension. His bold, powerful and seductive objects provide ample latitude for multiple interpretations. His love of painting is expressed by drawings in cobalt blue underglaze that often appear on the vessels and sometimes even on the bottoms of his larger, nonfunctional forms. Nele van Wieringen, director of Westerwald Ceramic Museum, writes: “Masamichi Yoshikawa’s colors are linked to memories. He calls the blue drawings in the porcelain ‘his diary.’ Seihakujiglaze, which recalls a cloudless sky or a glacier, melts and flows downward until the artist halts its motion by ending the firing. The drawings are ubiquitous, but not always visible: sometimes they are even on the underside of the artwork. These drawings link the objects to time as vessels conveying personal stories and traces of the artist.” Masamichi Yoshikawa, Kayho [Luxuriant pottery palace], 29 x 51,5 x 22 cm.

In 1996, she took the daring step of opening a gallery in Berlin where, in addition to her own jewelry, she showed pieces by internationally renowned jewelry artists. 2014 Dagmar Stühler returned to Munich and looks back now on 50 years of goldsmithing.

Dorothea Förster, born in 1954, attended the Goldschmiedeschule [goldsmiths’ school] in Pforzheim from 1974 to 1976. After completing her apprenticeship, she worked in Hamburg until 1981. Her artistic style was strongly influenced by her years at the Zeichenakademie in Hanau, from which she graduated as a state-certified designer and master goldsmith in 1983. She further developed her formal vocabulary, which is based on fundamental geometric elements, in several workshops after the turn of the millennium. Her retrospective catalogue, which was published in 2017, reveals a mature and multilayered artist’s personality. Dorothea Förster, Rings Circulation &#8211; Double &#8211; Medium &#8211; Open, 2013.

The two women’s oeuvres include connections, but also obvious differences. In addition to working with the hammer and driving hollow forms, Dagmar Stühler&#8217;s jewelry is famous for its finely shimmering surfaces. Dorothea Förster&#8217;s creations always convey a sketchlike, silhouette-like or playful element. A gemstone-studded ring, a wrought bracelet or a necklace by Dagmar Stühler calls to mind great craftsmanship and the goldsmith’s tradition, while Dorothea Förster’s pendants, rings and brooches feature more allusions to the concept",

    "biography": "The Westerwald Ceramic Museum presents a special show honoring the lifework of the mosaic artist Fritz Baumer (1919-1989), who created new artworks by assembling fragments of ceramics made by fellow ceramists Hubert Griemert, Richard Bampi, Wendelin Stahl others. Baumer separated the glaze from its substrate, i.e. the ceramic vessel, thus demonstrating the unique potential of ceramic color. Fritz Baumer, Schale [Bowl], 1986. Ceramic mosaic from sorted out vessels. Baumer received them by Hubert Griemert, Richard Bampi, Wendelin Stahl and others. Born in Frankfurt am Main in 1919 as the eldest son of a language teacher, Baumer spent his childhood and youth in Daun and Koblenz. His mosaic designs were first influenced by stories told by his grandfather, who worked for many years in the former German colony of Qingdao in China and owned a collection of Chinese art objects. Baumer’s imprisonment as a prisoner of war until 1949 in camps in Novosibirsk, Irkutsk, Tashkent, Samarkand, Alma Ata, Ulan Bator and Kyrgyzstan was a decisive turning point in his life. Alongside all the privations that he suffered, he was also decisively influenced by his encounters with Asian ceramics and mosaics. Fritz Baumer, Schwarzer Tisch [Black Table], 1967. Ceramic mosaics with captivatingly rich colors, textures and depths. He studied mosaic at the School of Arts and Crafts in Trier from 1936 to 1939. After returning from captivity in 1949, he enrolled at the Ceramic Academy in Höhr-Grenzhausen. Unable to afford costly glass or natural stones, he salvaged scrap from the academy’s rubbish heap. The ceramists themselves later sent their imperfect and therefore unusable pieces to Baumer, who smashed the rejected vessels into small shards, which he assembled into two-dimensional mosaic pictures. Fragments from matte-black crystal-glazed pieces by Hubert Griemert, salt-glazed shards from Heiner Balzar or Chinese red fragments from the Hohlt Brothers were transformed in Baumer’s hands into mosai",

    "biography": "Born in 1935, Wolfgang Skoluda from Hamburg has been made jewelry for 60 years. One of his greatest pleasures is “listening” to the found objects that he integrates into his jewelry. These items could be ancient carved gems, amulets or their fragments, but he also experiments with many other materials, e.g. “bits of glass from the Elbe, feathers from nearby forests and from Papua-New Guinea, and silk ribbons from Rud Witt.” His most enduring interest is to bridge classical antiquity and the present day, a project that determines his material (high-karat gold) and his formal vocabulary of classical forms. The Roemer- und Pelizaeus-Museum in Hildesheim honored his dialogue with antiquity by staging one-artist shows of his work in 1997 and 2015; the Goldsmith House in Hanau did likewise in 2006. Jewelry by Wolfgang Skoluda will be juxtaposed with works by ancient masters in the Staatliche Antikensammlung and the Glyptothek in Munich in 2019. The exhibit in Doris Sacher and Hans Gericke’s Galerie Ventil coincides with the International Crafts Fair and underscores the fact that Skoluda’s position enjoys an important place in contemporary jewelry.

The goldsmith Friederike Rohse, who likewise lives in Hamburg, apprenticed there with Thomas Schleede and studied in Schwäbisch Gmünd and at the drawing academy in Hanau. Lessons learned from the Korean painter Eu Nim Ro are decisive for her work: “Something jewel-like always comes into existence through the exploration of color and shape,” says this goldsmith, who also works with, silver, copper, enamel and precious stones, as well as natural lumps of amber or rubber stoppers, which she coats with paint.

    "biography": "The galleries staging auteurjewelry exhibitions to coincide with Munich’s International Crafts Fair include the Galerie tal20, which provides a platform for established and young emerging artists alike. This year’s joint exhibition, featuring Julia Obermaier, Germany, Kaori Juzu, Japan/Denmark and Gabi Veit from South Tyrol, promises to make for a multifaceted experience. Julia Obermaier, who studied in Neugablonz and Idar-Oberstein, creates geometrical bodies from agate and rock crystal slices, as well as silver. She regards the resulting hollow spaces enclosed by angles and corners as “a kind of spiritual space for the wearer’s feelings and emotions that protects the sensitive contents like a second skin.” Julia Obermaier, ring Getting close(d). Agate, silver. Kaori Juzu, who was born in Japan, trained as a goldsmith in Denmark. Later on, she also did a few stints as an artist-in-residence in Penland, North Carolina, and Erfurt, Thuringia. Her jewelry creations owe their unique aura to their delicately enameled, pastel-colored surfaces that also reference their immediate surroundings or the natural world, such as, e.g., “the moon’s shimmering reflection on a water surface – gently undulating or tranquil, yet sufficiently in motion to take shape and come to life.” Kaori Juzu, brooch From the Hidden Side of the Moon #5. Enamel, steel, copper, silver. Kaori Juzu, brooch From the Hidden Side of the Moon #2.Enamel, steel, magnet. The jewelry and spoons created by Gabi Veit have been inspired by her observing flowers and rocks, trees and mountains, water and wind, motion and stillness. With her “Fragments” jewelry line, she celebrates “the rough and jagged outlines of the mountains and rocks of South Tyrol, my ever-changing, multifaceted home region.” Gabi Veit refers to her spoons, which she calls “creatura”, as “possible and at the same time improbable figures” that all have a personality all their own. “They have a head and a body, they are handle and leg, they are f",

    "biography": "Scheytt Gallery in Schwabing has enriched Munich’s multifaceted jewelry scene since the end of 2016. The gallery focuses on the rich variety of individual workshops in Munich and its surrounding area. But Brigitte and Isabel Scheytt “want to bring them together with other arts,” so the Scheytts regularly stage solo exhibitions of contemporary painting, photographic art, graphic art and sculpture. These two sisters also strive for a better world. For example, they made their gallery space available at the end of 2018 to the Capricorn Foundation, which fights against the genital mutilation of young girls. Jewelry from Kenya was shown during the lecture. Scheytt Gallery will also be present during Jewelry Week at the International Crafts Fair: an exhibit of works by Marie Ishikawa and Mia Maljojoki in 2018 will be followed this year by Susanne Elstner’s show “From the Ashes.” Susanne Elstner, necklace. Charcoal, silver. Susanne Elstner, brooch. Charcoal, 750 gold. Susanne Elstner, a master goldsmith who lives and works in Munich, trained in Neugablonz from 1981 to 1984. Later she continued her education under Erico Nagai and Giovanni Corvaja at the Academy of Design. She has worked as a freelance goldsmith in Gräfelfing since 1995. The way Susanne Elstner uses charcoal for expressive necklaces and brooches is unparalleled anywhere in the world. She makes the charcoal herself from larch wood because the larch tree’s annual rings result in especially interesting structures. The complex process begins with the choosing the pieces of wood and the cut, which determine the subsequent shape. The material’s thickness and the meticulous charring process also contribute to the final appearance. Susanne Elstner developed a process to stabilize the charcoal so it can undergo further processing without blackening other surfaces. The exhibition displays pieces of jewelry in frames hung on the wall so that after they have been worn, the pieces of jewelry needn’t disappear into a draw",

    "biography": "“Collect” is the only trade fair in the genre of arts and crafts that restricts participation solely to galleries and institutions. Represented are art genres such as author jewelry, studio ceramics, metal, glass or textile art. After the demise of “Tresor” in Basel, which was launched with similar ambitions, “Collect” is the only remaining European fair with this concept. Organized by the Crafts Council in Great Britain, the sales fair offers “the opportunity to discover and invest in exceptional works created by living artists during the past five years.” Many of items on display were fabricated exclusively for the fair. Nearly half of the exhibitors come from Great Britain. One reason for this is the locational advantage, while another is the unmistakably greater importance which craft, i.e. artistic handcraftsmanship, enjoys in the British Isles. Galerie Metzger from Johannisberg, Germany is the only exhibitor venturing to London from Germany this year. Galerie Metzger, Hans Fischer, Untitled, 2017. Ceramic, 34 x 11 x 6cm.

    "biography": "The exhibition which is also showing works of applied arts from China, Japan and Korea, has been one of the museum’s focal points since its founding over 150 years ago. Uli Sigg, who was born in 1946, began compiling the world’s most representative collection of Chinese art in the mid-1990s. He experienced the upheavals in China as a journalist, entrepreneur and Swiss ambassador to China, North Korea and Mongolia, and also promoted international careers for many artists, e.g. Ai Weiwei. Ai Weiwei, Descending Light with A Missing Circle, 2017. © Ai Weiwei, Photo Bruno Bühlmann, Photo Jung, Sursee/Switzerland. The show’s title, “Chinese Whispers: New Art from the Sigg Collection,” refers to the children’s game in which each child whispers a message into a neighbor’s ear and the content becomes progressively more distorted as it passes from one hearer to the next. The influences of Socialist Realism and censorship are still palpable in China today, but a new generation of Chinese artists has quickly taken up modern Western trends and responded to the political and social situation. The controversial role of the individual, feminist aspects of the revolution and the dissolution of private space can be felt in many of the works shown in “Chinese Whispers.” Wang Xingwei, My Beautiful Life, 1993–1995. Oil on canvas. Courtesy Sigg Collection. © Wang Xingwei. Shi Jinsong, Lack Pine Tree, 2011. Wood. Courtesy Sigg Collection. © Shi Jinsong. Cultural products are traditionally not always linked with individual authors, but are frequently created collectively in China, where patterns and systems are often adopted and role models are eagerly adapted. East and West have thus developed ambivalent views of original, copy, interpretation and forgery. Ai Weiwei explores the boundary between visual art and design as reflected by history in his installation “Descending Light with a Missing Circle” (2017), which was commissioned by the Sigg Collection.

    "biography": "The jewelry and watch industry starts its new season at the Inhorgenta Munich trade fair from February 22-25, 2019. A few weeks later, the same venue hosts the International Crafts Fair with “Handwerk &amp; Design,” the world’s most important meeting place for art jewelry. The Crafts Fair is open to the public, but Inhorgenta is reserved for trade buyers, although artistic craftsmanship is also present here in Hall C2: e.g. in the “Silversmiths’ Forum,” at the universities’ group exhibitions and at the stand of the Bayerischer Kunstgewerbeverein [Bavarian Arts and Crafts Association] (BKV). For modern jewelry design the Inhorgenta Trade Fair is unique – but it could be better The exhibitors in Hall C2, along with several studios and manufactories in Hall B1, represent a jewelry culture that is more strongly shaped by modern art and design here than anywhere else in the world. As our examples show, a whole series of designers and manufacturers at Inhorgenta stand for the highest quality in design and manufacturing. They’re complemented by innovations from designers who are not represented at Inhorgenta this year. Some names of the halls at Inhorgenta sound rather ambitious, e.g. “Timepieces” for watches or “Elegance &amp; Lifestyle” for costume jewelry. “Fine Jewelry” is the title of Hall B1, where German manufacturers such as Niessing, Henrich&amp;Denzel and IsabelleFa will show their pieces; and Hall C2 will be called “Contemporary Design &amp; Vision.” Also somewhat confusing is the large number of themes in Hall C2, where circa 280 goldsmiths, silversmiths, designers and artists will gather in 2019. “Brand New –New Brand” is the name of the entry-level platform for university graduates. The so-called “Forum Innovation” is likewise reserved for newcomers, although it has been years since anything even marginally innovative has been shown here. Established designers can be found in “Forum Konzepte.” Leen Heyne, ring Marquis. Knotted ring, dark grey gold, brown diam",

Wolfgang Lösche, the director of the special show by the Crafts Chamber of Munich and Upper Bavaria, regards the applications by 762 goldsmiths from 58 countries as proof of “the strong importance ascribed to jewelry worldwide.” A different well-known personality appraises each year’s submittals and chooses a small selection for display at special show. The choices for 2019 were made by Sabine Runde, chief curator of the Museum of Applied Arts in Frankfurt, who selected works by 65 artists from 22 countries to be exhibited in the special Schmuck show. The conferral of the Herbert Hofmann Prize, which is awarded to as many as three artists, traditionally follows on the Saturday morning of each year’s Crafts Fair: the upcoming awards ceremony will begin at 5 p.m. on March 16, 2019 in Hall B1 at the International Crafts Fair.

Elgin Fischer works playfully with colored enamel. Monika Glöss stands for clear forms with refined details. Ulrike Poelk’s jewelry can be worn in numerous and unexpected ways. And Julia Reymann creates multilayered forms from filigreed wire bodies and Japan paper. Unconventional materials, shapes or ways of wearing repeatedly invite people to see jewelry in a new light. Another guest in the exhibition of the Bauhaus year at noon: Mia Kwon, brooch Klarheit02 [clarity02]. Mont Blanc porcelain, pigment, steel, silk, glass. Alongside the five noon designers, the exhibit also presents work by 23 other designers who live in Berlin. Six of them came from the disciplines of glass, ceramic, interior design and accessories. Most of the participants’ collections already contained pieces influenced by the aesthetics and ideas of the Bauhaus. Several exhibitors use the exhibit’s theme as an opportunity to explore the Bau",

The show presents one-of-a-kind items from Lobmeyr Glas (Vienna) and Anna Torfs (Prague), as well the gallery owner’s own pieces from Rotter Glas (Lübeck). Also on display are glass objects by Regina and Norbert Kaufmann (Glashütte Glashagen), Cornelius Réer (Nuremberg), Wiebke Vogt (Berlin), the glass manufactory of the glass school in Zwiesel, Michael Schwarzmüller (Karlsruhe), Pia Wüstenberg (Alt Duvenstedt) and Jean-Pierre Baquere (Paris). Rotter glass, ball cup and coils blue A glass cup from Rotter Glas gets its cut. © Perlbach Fotodesign When Birgit Rotter, the owner of Rotter Glass manufactory in Lübeck, first opened Artemani ten years ago, she had already made it her personal goal to present, in the historical city of Lübeck, products from handpicked manufactories and by renowned artists and craftspeople. Regular exhibitions round out the gallery’s concept. Visitors can repeatedly expect new focal points from the genres of ceramic, porcelain, wood, glass, jewelry, textiles, painting and much more. Birgit Rotter says: “Artemani’s customers love variety and are happy to know that they can always find pleasantly surprising products and new inspirations here.” The anniversary exhibit offers plenty of both. Anna Torfs. Masterful glass design from the Czech Republic Among the many highlights of the exhibition are glass objects by Anna Torfs: the high art of Czech glassmaking expresses itself here in the rich palette of colors and the play with light and shadow in the spectrum of strict geometry and organically poetic nature. The glacier series from Lobmeyr Glas manufacture in Vienna is likewise remarkably expressive, as are the precisely cut vessels from Rotter Glas, a fourth-generation manufactory of crystal glassware.

    "biography": "The 2018 edition of the prize received close to 1,900 submissions from a total of 86 countries across the globe; potential candidates for this year’s edition are invited to study the guidelines and submit work at loewecraftprize.com. Jennifer Lee from Great Britain won the Loewe Craft Prize in 2018 and 50,000 euros The first edition of the Loewe craft prize was launched by the loewe foundation in 2016 to showcase and celebrate excellence, artistic merit and newness in modern craftsmanship. It seeks to acknowledge and support international artisans of any age (over 18) or gender who demonstrate an exceptional ability to create objects of superior aesthetic value, with the winner receiving 50,000 Euros in cash. The award, which was conceived by creative director Jonathan Anderson, aims to acknowledge the importance of craft in today’s culture and recognise working artisans whose talent, vision and will to innovate set a standard for the future. The incentive for the prize goes back to Loewe’s beginnings as a collective craft workshop in 1846. Jonathan Anderson states ‘Now in its third year, I am incredibly proud of the part the Loewe Craft Prize has had to play in elevating the critical reception of craft and its ability to bring beautiful objects to an international audience. It has been awe-inspiring to see exceptional work from artisans around the globe being entered year on year and an honour to exhibit their work.’ Out of 1.900 applicants Marie Janssen from Vienna reached the short list of 30 artists Adi Toch, GB, was one of the few jewelry artists who reached the final selection The Judging Procedure An experts panel composed of artists, artisans, essayists, curators and designers will consider all submitted works in order to select a shortlist of up to 30 submissions. Their choice will be based on a number of key criteria: originality, clear artistic vision and merit, precise execution, material excellence, innovative value and a distinct authorial mark. These ",

    "biography": "Marjan Unger. Photo courtesy Margriet Sopers Marjan Unger was one of the best-known experts, collectors and authors of contemporary art jewelry. At the craft fair in Munich she was a welcome guest and often present at the award ceremony of the Herbert Hofmann Awards. For Art Aurea it was a special honor to be able to win Marjan Unger as a writer in the first issue 2010 after its re-founding. Another exiting document of her thinking about jewelry is the interview that Chris Reinewald conducted with Marjan Unger in Art Aurea, issue 3-2011. I got to know her as a profound, humorous but also critical woman and humanist and am grateful for the encounters with her. I also thank Helen Drutt, the great American gallery owner for art jewelry and crafts, who has sent me the news of the demise of Marjan Unger. She was born February 11, 1946 at Bussum, The Netherlands and died June 27, 2018 at the same city. From 1995 to 2006, Marjan Unger worked as Head of the Free Design Department at the Sandberg Institute, which offers degrees in association with the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam. During the eighties she was editor-in-chief of the free design magazine Bijvoorbeeld and was involved in the Precious Metals Department at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie. Her book Dutch Jewellery in the 20th Century was published in 2004 and was the first product of her doctoral research which she started in 1995 and finished in 2010. To mark the occasion, Marjan and her husband Gerard donated her collection of nearly 500 pieces of Dutch jewelery to the Rijksmuseum. The collection, which covers the period 1905-2008, with a focus on the years 1930-1970, served as reference material for her book. On November 15-17, 2017 a symposium entitled “Jewellery Matters” was held in honor of her collection at the Rijksmuseum. Suzanne van Leeuwen, Junior Curator of Jewellery at the Rijksmuseum, along with Marjan, coauthered the accompanying recent publication Jewellery Matters earlier this year. Above tex",

    "biography": "Neues deutsches Design is history. For the furniture artist Christoph Siebrasse, conscious, sensible sitting is still an important topic The furniture and lamps of “Neues deutsches Design” [New German Design] had been a counter concept to “Die Gute Form” [The Good Form] à la Max Bill, which was considered dogmatic in the 1980s. Neues deutsches Design was also seen as a German response to Italian Postmodernism, Studio Alchimia and Memphis. Christoph R. Siebrasse and Rainer Schenk were part of the movement which is now a bygone chapter in design history. But both have continued until today. An article entitled “How Much Avant-garde Is (Still) Allowed?” ran in the 3-1993 edition of “Art Aurea”. A full-page photo showed the furniture artist Christoph R. Siebrasse seated in his “Freidenker” [free thinker]. The construction of square steel recalls antique school desks, but could also be interpreted as a minimalistic sculpture and used as a lectern. The steel construction has three marble slabs: the lower slab is a footrest at a height of circa 50 cm; the middle slab is a seat; and the upper slab is a small work surface. Siebrasse is shown seated, his palms resting on the table surface and his spine vertical. His posture and his construction form a unity. The furniture artist shows what the Freidenker encourages: conscious, palpable sitting; concentrated work; and meditation. Manfred Schneckenburger described the concept for a 1996 exhibit: “The humanist Siebrasse has recognized an important fact: living at home, belonging to a space, sitting and lying must be actively interpreted and actively lived. He enlivens these activities with tension and contemplation, movement and rest, individuality and stimulation. Refusing to allow us the all-too-comfortable self-flattery of ergonomically streamlined shapes that conform to the human anatomy, he understands ergonomics not as total conformity, but as a precise appeal to bodily experience. He provokes this physical experience – an",

    "biography": "Luca Lanzi, *1977, in his studio in Bologna But anyone who expects a collection of harmless, readily comprehensible cuteness is likely to feel disconcerted by Lanzi’s idiosyncratic cosmos of awkward masklike dolls, archaic depictions of animals and abstractly schematized plants. This artist from Bologna explores these subjects in ceramics and in delicate pastel sketches. His creations may remind their viewer of seemingly familiar objects or call to mind events that the beholder has personally experienced. Observers might be reminded of toys from their childhood, children’s sketches or cult objects from indigenous cultures. Luca Lanzi, Rebus, 2016. Terracotta, plaster, 24 x 38 x 23 cm Photo Eric Chernov Luca Lanzi, Cavallino, 2016, terracotta, plaster, 27 x 28 x 23 cm Although they are deliberately not endowed with a narrative quality, the stereotypical jointed dolls without physiognomic individuality – which Lanzi often entitles “Feticcio” (“Fetish”) – serve this artist as bearers of strongly expressive messages. The inconspicuous colored allusions in the painted surfaces of some figures hint at the vulnerability of all living creatures and allow these artworks, with all their ambiguity, to function as screens for individual projections. Anyone who surrenders to the magic of Luca Lanzi’s enigmatic creations leaves behind the mechanized, explicable world of daily life and embarks on an adventure of associations and ambivalent feelings – not only exploring the traces of one’s own individual’s past, but also undertaking a cultural voyage of discovery. Luca Lanzi, Bola d&#8217;Aria, 2012. Mixed media on paper, 70 x 50 cm The exhibit opens at 11:30 a.m. on May 27, 2018. The artist will be present.

One has been given to French textile artist, Simone Pheulpin, for her work Croissance XL, 2017. The jury commented: “Simone Pheulpin is redefining what we think of as textiles. She has elevated humble recycled materials into something truly remarkable.” Another special mention was given to Japanese potter Takuro Kuwata for his work Tea Bowl, 2017.

    "biography": "Within the context of contemporary visual art, digital technology raises some interesting questions. For instance, how does modern technology relate to the artisanal efforts of the artist, and what do new techniques do to the magic and mystery of making and creating? What does modern technology mean to artistic practice, and what motivates artists to integrate these new techniques into their work? Beate Eismann and Svenja John use 3D printing, laser cutting and computer-controlled design in their works. A high-quality 3D printer is included in the exhibition, allowing visitors to familiarise themselves with an important part of Svenja John and Beate Eismann’s professional practice.

Photo Ludger Paffrath Beate Eismann, Ring Ice Flower in Titanium, 2015. 3,5 x 3,5 x 5 cm. Photo Sascha Linke The thirtieth anniversary of 3D printing, CODA Museum’s interest in jewellery and the artistic quality of both artists prompted CODA to bring the work of Svenja John and Beate Eismann together in an exhibition. Although both artists focus on and are fascinated with digital processes and new techniques, John and Eismann have their own, distinct visual language. Svenja John – a Pioneer of Digital Technology into Art Svenja John (*1963) developed a preference for the precision of computer-controlled techniques. In 1994, John started working with Makrolon®, a polycarbonate that is frequently used in car manufacturing. Using CAD technology, she cuts the material into parts that then, after processing and colouring, become components of her complex, geometric jewellery. Rapid prototyping has been part of her work process since 2008. By employing 3D printers that can print different materials simultaneously, she combines design and the application of a variety of colours in one process.

Far from the mainstream, the items on display in Munich appeal to jewelry lovers, fashionistas and fans of contemporary design. “Many visitors use Handwerk &amp; Design to get an overview, to meet special craftspeople and to see exclusive products, or to schedule a personal appointment for visiting an atelier after the fair,” says Dieter Dohr, chairman of the board of GHM Gesellschaft für Handwerksmessen mbH. Under the title Ways to Design, academies, colleges and universities update visitors about their educational programs and offer live demonstrations of craftsmanly techniques in active workshops Particular attractions at Handwerk &amp; Design are the special shows Exempla, Talente, Meister der Moderne and Schmuck. Schmuck (Jewelry), which is regarded as world’s most important exhibit of contemporary auteur jewelry, annually makes Munich a meeting place for the international jewelry scene.

    "biography": "Mari Ishikawa, a Japanese artist who lives in Munich, puts jewelry into a unique relationship with her landscape photos. This juxtaposition reveals parallel worlds that exist beyond everyday life. During the Crafts Fair, Galerie Scheytt will display these photographic artworks, which were created in the Atacama Desert in Chile and on the Easter Islands between 2016 and 2017, and which make the boundaries between sky and earth visible with breathtakingly lucid beauty. Mari Ishikawa, photograph of the Atacama Desert in Chile © Mari Ishikawa Mari Ishikawa, Border chain. 925 oxidized silver, silk, 2017, l. 200 cm Mari Ishikawa, rings from the Shadow series. 925 oxidized silver But boundaries do not only delimit spaces and landscapes: they also define time, personality and identity. This realization resulted in new chains that symbolize borders, as well as rings and brooches. These silver or gold castings are based on natural forms, but are reborn like shadows with diamonds, pearls or silk, explains Mari Ishikawa, who would like them to interrupt the flow of ephemerality. The precious object should resolve itself out of the cycle of life and death “to stand for itself and for the moment.” Born in 1964, Mari Ishikawa studied in Japan and at the Academy of Visual Arts in Munich. She has won numerous awards, and her artworks are represented in important public collections. Mia Maljojoki, Amazonia # 8 necklace. Porcelain, acrylic, silver, gold The gallery of the Scheytt Sisters in Munich The Schyett Sisters’ gallery, which was established at the end of 2016, augments its thematic spectrum of fine art in dialogue with jewelry by presenting this exhibit of Mari Ishikawa’s artworks, which will be on display during the Crafts Fair.

    "biography": "Travel is essential for Judy McCaigh, who was born in Edinburgh and has lived in Barcelona since 1991. From the deserts of New Mexico to far-flung locations in Chile, Argentina and Uruguay, she explores exotic landscapes, discloses secrets and experiences surprises: for example, a trash container with the quality of a sculpture, which inspired her to create a series of brooches. “Recurrent symbols appear in my work, fragments of landscapes, micro worlds – narrative, personal, like a traveler’s diary,” this jewelry artist says. Judy McCaigh, brooch The Space between, 2017. German silver, tombac, gold leaf, gold mosaic Like Ramon Puig Cuyás and Silvia Walz, Judy McCaigh numbers among those artists whose pieces of jewelry are autonomous works of art. Such artworks are not defined by the value of their materials, but solely by their aesthetic presence, their message and its underlying history. One of the pioneers in this genre is Ramon Puig Cuyás, who was a professor at Escola Massana in Barcelona from 1977 to 2016. He likens his pieces to the golden plaque aboard the Voyager spacecraft, which carries information about our civilization into the vastness of outer space, or to a letter inside a corked bottle, which was thrown into the sea by a shipwrecked sailor. “My creations are accordingly messages to the world, coupled with the hope that someone will take an interest in them and understand the mysteries that all artworks harbor.” Ramon Puig Cuyás, brooch, series The Sounds of the Hearth, 2017. Oxidized nickel silver, enamel on steel, reconstructed white coral, basalt Silvia Walz, who comes from the Gelsenkirchen in Germany, likewise taught at Escola Massana in Barcelona. This jewelry artist had long regarded cloisonné enamel as taboo – until she discovered that “one needn’t necessarily imprison it inside little partitions, but can also use it to form larger planes.” Numerous experiments preceded the “Porta-skies,” “Parable” and “Broken Sky” series of brooches, with wh",

Photo Tresor Autumn, the season of important exhibitions in the applied arts and design, began at the end of September with the premiere of “Tresor – Contemporary Craft” in Basel. The organizers are talking about a success in their final report on their website. After sales valued well over 800,000 Swiss francs, cofounder Nadine Vischer sees excellent perspectives for the future. This affirmatively answers the question of whether a new fair for high-quality crafts can successfully establish itself in Central Europe. We are likewise pleased that we were able to contribute toward familiarizing a new audience of collectors with artistic crafts by publishing Tresor’s catalogue in the print edition of Art Aurea. Our journalistic collaboration with the Grassi Fair in Leipzig celebrates its seventh anniversary. The fair opens on Thursday, October 19, 2017 with the conferral of the Grassi Awards. Founded already 1920 as &#8220;Meetingpoint of the Modern&#8221;, this is the oldest German museum fair. Its catalogue is published in the current issue of Art Aurea, which is now available. The thematic focal point is “The Future of the Workshop,” which has lost none of its fascination, even in times of digitization. The ceramic artist Johannes Nagel from the city of Halle works innovatively and is asked by collectors worldwide. Photo Nikolaus Brade One example of the confluence of craftsmanship and art is described in the report about Johannes Nagel. This ceramist from Halle has grappled with the vessel for the past fifteen years and has proven that this utilitarian and cultural object can indeed be transformed into sought-after artworks. The Briton Edmund de Waal numbers among the greatest protagonists of ceramic art. Not only is de Waal’s work shown at major art fairs and in art galleries, he is also an impassioned potter and the author of bestsellers such as The Hare with Amber Eyes. Renate Luckner-Bien",

But art and much of culture as we now perceive and appreciate them could scarcely exist without collectors. The collecting activities of museums, foundations and private individuals enable the general public to experience art, which surely provides countless moments of greater and smaller happiness. Art Aurea&#8217;s current issue: &#8220;Ice Water Glass and Hovering Bowls&#8221; – glass objects and photographs by Hans Hansen. Glass object, Tora Urup, photo Hans Hansen Glass object by Tora Urup, photographed by Hans Hansen Collecting naturally also makes some artists happy: not solely because collectors are often the buyers of the artworks, but “also because this is associated with appreciation and care for the purchased objects,” as Tora Urup explains in an interview in our new print magazine. Her glass art and many other wonderful glass objects are on display in the “Eiswasserglas” (“Ice Water Glass”) exhibit at the Gewerbemuseum (Museum of Applied Arts and Design) in Winterthur. These pieces were collected by the Hamburg-based photographer Hans Hansen, who is now showing them to the public for the first time, along with surprising photos of his objects.

Photo Miriam Künzli How fulfilling – to leave unspoken that overworked word “happiness” – collecting can be is also a theme in an article about gallerist Rosemarie Jäger. She started collecting spoons while still a teenager. Years later, this developed into a gallery activity that could hardly be more holistic and more meaningful – in part because this gallerist from the winegrowing town of Hochheim in Hesse focuses on a theme that needs special care.

    "biography": "Kyra Spieker is interested in changing surfaces and lines Analytic and poetic explorations of space and light are fundamental to the work of Kyra Spieker (*1957). Her minimalistic artifacts are characterized by clear order paired with the highest aesthetics. Her porcelain or stoneware pieces gain even greater expressiveness through occasional partnering with other materials such as aluminum or glass. The majority of her current reliefs or freestanding sculptures are based on a module which she developed and which provides the variables that she explores in diverse ways. Solitary or compounded, in series or layers, wholly in white or multicolored, closed or open: this artist repeatedly finds new geometric constructions in which this module can be discovered as the ordering element. Kyra Spieker consciously includes daylight as a component of the design. Its changes during the course of the day cause subtle differences in the appearance of the surfaces of her objects. An observer of this phenomenon can experience moments of almost meditative intensity. anderorts [elsewhere], 2016. Stoneware, chrome foil, 10 x 45 x 45 cm View, 2017. Stoneware, glazes, 33 x 33 x 33 cm Kyra Spieker’s special interest in architecture and in qualities that create space, her partiality for alternation between planes and lines, and last but not least her penchant for the structuring property of light make the light-flooded Keramion a very special exhibition venue for her. The elegant architecture of this unconventional museum seems to experience a veritable echo through the lightness and the sometimes apparently weightless quality of her mostly light-colored porcelain objects. But formal and aesthetic aspects are not the sole basis for the congeniality between the surroundings and the exhibited artifacts: contentually too, this artist directly references the museum through the utilized materials and her reflection on this ceramic locale.

Textile designer Barbara Hattrup from Salzkotten won the prize in the “sculpture” category for a wall installation made of fiber tiles with inner bark from the paper mulberry tree. Alessa Joosten from Düsseldorf, who is studying jewelry design, won the prize with a graphically sculptural wooden chain: her use of a renewable raw material harmonizes with the concept of sustainable design. Konrad Koppold, a cabinetmaker and interior designer from Leverkusen, convinced the jurors to win the prize in the “home living” category for his asymmetrical lathe-turned oak containers.

    "biography": "Nikolay Sardamov, brooch The secret of the garden. Courtesy Eva Maisch, Würzburg Secret gardens are places of longing that have inspired artists in every epoch. The motif of the garden lends wings to our imagination, awakens our yearnings, and transports us out of everyday life into dreamy spheres. This motif recurs in countless fairytales and legends, in poems and stories, on textiles and in pictures – and in the contemporary applied arts. With her “Secret Gardens” exhibition, Eva Maisch reaffirms her sensitivity for imaginative thematic exhibits. Each show highlights different aspects and techniques of contemporary crafts and design. Visitors can encounter works by renowned artists and designers and can also find creations by international greats whose work is less well known here in Germany. Milan Pekar, Crystalline Glaze Vase, porcelain. To be seen in the gallery Eva Maisch, Würzburg This time, for example, there’s the Czech artist Milan Pekař and his mostly monochrome porcelain containers, which have diverse crystalline glazes that he develops through laborious experimentation. Born in 1980, this ceramist has taught since 2011 at the institute for ceramics and porcelain at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. The wonderful textile artworks by Roos Soetekouw from Amsterdam are likewise little known in Germany. This Dutch designer mixes traditional and modern techniques, while always taking pains to preserve the original character of the textiles. Soetekouw sketches and paints to create her designs, but she also uses computer programs. And although she combines widely diverse materials, her goal is always to give visible form to a story that often goes far beyond the theme of the garden.

    "biography": "Superlative craftsmanship and clever designs are nowhere near sufficient to win laurels at the &#8220;Talente&#8221; show in Munich. Many creations showcased at the Crafts &amp; Design exhibition within the context of the International Crafts Fair also convey meaningful contents, messages or concepts. But in contrast to fine art, they have been crafted by artisans who remain faithful to their characteristic material and genre. Eight participants have been awarded. Adéla Wiesenbergová, Czech Republic, necklace Nude of Yakuza. Padouk veneer, 60x110x45 cm The poetic piece created by Adéla Wiesenbergová from the Czech Republic is particularly interesting because of its lightweight, fragile appearance, its cocoon-like quality and its references to Japan, not least in terms of eroticism and traditional garments, the jurors commented. Machteld Lambeets, Belgium, Brown Bowl. Bio resin, grass, soil, pigment, tape, pape Machteld Lambeets from Belgium experiments with materials, traditional concepts, shapes and three-dimensionality. The jurors were fascinated by her creation’s sculptural aura and its surface texture reminiscent of landscapes. Luise Hellmann, Germany, tile installation nichts über fliesen [nothing about tiles]. Red clay, 140x280x8 cm Luise Hellmann from Germany re-interprets Mediterranean tiles from the 17th century, also playing with historical and traditional aspects. Individually and sculpturally designed, her pieces constitute a striking alternative to industrially produced tiles and the current trend towards imitation tiles crafted from other materials, the jurors explained. Kana Ueda, Japan, Vase, Semi-porcelain, clay inlays, 17x19x19 cm Featuring intricate lines and subtle color gradients, the illusionistic vessels created by Kana Ueda from Japan evoke associations with materials such as stone or fur, a concept the jurors deemed worthy of a prize. Yasutomo Ota, Japan/Germany, Die Forelle (The Trout). Paper, thread, wood, Linocut, digital print ,15,8 x 33",

    "biography": "Brooch, 1983. Silver, fabric, 9,5 cm. Photo Janos Stekovics The goldsmith Renate Heintze (1936–1991) belonged to the generation of jewelry artists who, in the 1960s, transcended the boundaries of their craft’s traditionally artisanal work and became trailblazers of international auteur jewelry. She was head of the jewelry class at Burg Giebichenstein University of Art and Design Halle from 1974 until her death. Complemented by design sketches and models, the book’s comprehensive illustration section shows selected works from all of her work groupings. Many of these jewelry creations form part of public and private collections nowadays. The Art Museum in Moritzburg Halle, the Museum of Decorative Arts in Berlin and the Grassi Museum of Applied Arts in Leipzig have even acquired larger collections of her jewelry. Since the Danner Rotunda was created in 2004, Renate Heintze’s creations have also been showcased as part of the permanent exhibition of the Neue Sammlung – the International Design Museum in Munich. In addition to the large-format photos, the monograph includes five succinctly written essays by renowned authors, plus a commented and illustrated biography, providing condensed information about an artist whose oeuvre perfectly illustrates the prevalent image of contemporary art jewelry. The book will be published to accompany the exhibition entitled “Renate Heintze. A Modern Classic” at the special “Jewelry 2017” show at Munich’s International Crafts Fair, as well as the speech entitled “Renate Heintze – her path to studio jewelry” that Katja Schneider will be giving at the Neue Sammlung – the International Design Museum in Munich’s Pinakothek der Moderne on 12 March 2017.

    "biography": "His jewelry in the form of miniature sculptures seems to hold a sense of humor while being sensuous and exaggerated in a kind of comic-strip style. Nevertheless it also contains an intense philosophical examination, mostly of antiquity. Manfred Bischoff (1947–2015) is deemed to be one of the most innovative and important jewelry artists of our time. The goldsmith was born in Schömberg in the Black Forest area and died in his adopted home in Italy. After his apprenticeship he studied jewelry design with Reinhold Reiling at the University for Applied Sciences in Pforzheim as well as goldsmithing at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. Manfred Bischoff’s works can be found in many private and museum collections around the world. For twelve years he taught at the Alchimia School of Goldsmithing in Florence, helping to establish the school’s international acclaim, while familiarizing a multitude of young goldsmiths with the art and craft of their trade. His colleagues held him in high esteem. Manfred Bischoff lived and worked for many years in San Casciano dei Bagni in the province of Siena. Photos Federico Cavicchioli Gold and coral were the preferred materials of the jewelery artist Manfred Bischoff As a tribute to Manfred Bischoff and on the occasion of the International Craft Fair in Munich Galerie Handwerk presents works of his from 1980 up until shortly before his death. Most of all, there will be not only numerous pieces of jewelry from his early work but also drawings, gouaches and personal objects from his house in Southern Tuscany. In doing so, Galerie Handwerk cooperates with Rike Bartels, the administrator of Manfred Bischoff’s estate in Munich. Altogether, around 80 pieces of jewelry from that archive will be on display. They document the various stages of his œuvre and all the hallmarks of his works that Manfred Bischoff had developed into an artistic style of his own from the 1990s. That style is characterized by the three levels of “jewelry, drawing and ti",

The vessels of Albrecht Hohlt (1928-1960) are characterized by the joy of experimentation and the passion of the ceramist, and the works of Goerge Hohlt (* 1938) stand for precision and perfectionism. The pure style and outstanding glazes inspire to this day. The ceramics by Albrecht and Goerge Hohlt can now be seen in the new exhibition hall and gallery emilith in Krefeld, Germany. The title is &#8220;Die Herren Hohlt&#8221;. Otto Hohlt, Large jug made of clay and blue bowl, private collection Darmstadt The father Otto, who studied painting in Munich with Wilhelm von Debschitz and Franz von Stuck, began 1945 with the setup of the atelier named &#8220;Werkstatt Hohlt&#8221; in Katzbach, Southern Germany. He had already created terracotta figures before – from the regionally occurring, red-burning clay. The training of the two sons was unorthodox and more autodidactic, the journeyman&#8217;s examination took place at the Academy of Arts in Munich. A key moment for Albrecht was the encounter with the works by Jan Bontjes van Beek and also the visit of a Cologne exhibition with Asian ceramics from the Song and Kangxi period. He began a systematic research on reduction glazes on turned porcelain. At the 1951 Triennale in Milan the brothers came to know the Scandinavian design of Stig Lindberg and Arabia, which influenced their own works in a lasting way. Goerge Hohlt, vase forms, stoneware &#8220;Werkstatt Hohlt&#8221; became a true brand and received many awards and prizes. During the first years the marking of the products was done with a uniform stamp, which makes it nearly impossible to determine the designer nowadays. Albrecht&#8217;s method of working in the workshop was excessive, and he constantly threw moth balls with napthalene into the kiln to achieve the best reduction results. In 1956 he was diagnosed with cancer. In his last years he created an extraordinary collection and legacy. After t",

    "biography": "The first manufactory for pocket watches, jewelry and fine steel merchandise was established in Pforzheim under the initiative of Margrave Karl Friedrich in 1767. This marked the beginning of the city’s progress toward becoming a Mecca for jewelry and timepieces. In 1913, approximately half of the city’s 75,000 residents were employed in the jewelry and watch industry. Pforzheim was almost completely destroyed during the Second World War. It took until 1953 before the city at the edge of the Black Forest again became the world’s largest manufacturer of jewelry and silver merchandise. Although nearly the entire watchmaking industry and a large percentage of the jewelry companies had been compelled to close their doors forever by the turn of millennium, Pforzheim is still formatively shaped by jewelry in 2017, when the city celebrates its 250th anniversary. The “Gold City” has an impressive jewelry museum with one of the world’s most important collections. The school for goldsmiths and watchmakers, as well as the academy for design, are important educational institutions that train goldsmiths and designers, many of whom remain in Pforzheim afterwards because the city offers them an optimal infrastructure for their métiers.

Her classic designs can be found in the collections of major museums worldwide, including the British Museum or the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Born in Hungary, Zeisel studied painting in Budapest and then turned to pottery in order to support herself. The influence of the Bauhaus and the International style are obvious in her early works. She was incarcerated 1936 in Russia for several months, because she was wrongly suspected of an assassination attempt on Stalin. Being jewish, she had to flee from the Nazis who had annexed Austria in 1938, and she finally emigrated to the USA. Her modern, clean style influenced the American homes on the same level as Charles and Ray Eames or Russell Wright. She went on to work for factories in many countries and worked in a world, which at the time was primarily dominated by men. Her mantra was the &#8220;playful search for beauty&#8221;, creating individual and timeless objects. She died 2011 in New York, 105 years old. In the last design auction of the year, Wright offered rare pieces from the personal collection of Eva Zeisel, as well as works by Axel Salto and Ka-Kwong Hui. Eva Zeisel, teapot, 1929.

    "biography": "Draft sketches or drawings capture spontaneous intuitions and fleeting impressions. They serve to generate ideas while documenting the design process of artists as well as designers. Sometimes they even turn out to be artworks in their own right, revealing, mostly with the benefit of hindsight, the spirit and soul not just of the author but also of an era or an age of style or design. The exhibition Private Confessions unfurls the extraordinary talents in drawing and painting of the distinguished jewelry artists from the second half of the 20th century to the present. The selection of 36 stars of that scene comprises around 400 drawings, sketchbooks, installations and pieces of jewelry. Among them are minimalist sketches and objects, calligraphic statements as well as narrative watercolors and even opulent paintings. Hermann Jünger, watercolor, 1980ies. Watercolors, opaque colors, paper, 30,5 × 43,5 cm. Photo Lorli &amp; Ernst Jünger The curator Ellen Maurer-Zilioli has chosen such pioneers of contemporary jewelry art since 1945 as Hermann Jünger, Anton Cepka, Manfred Nisslmüller, Bernhard Schobinger or Giampaolo Babetto as well as renowned representatives of the middle and younger generations. Finally, the show includes works by artists, such as Bruno Martinazzi and Claus Bury, who have also gained fame as sculptors. The organizers write that their show is not just accompanying the discourse on jewelry but, moreover, proves to be a counterforce and counterweight to all the functional limitations and obligations of the discipline. The show makes no claim to completeness, “but opens a completely new chapter on the reception and reflection of the field of artistic activity that is contemporary auteur jewelry.” On this we may agree. Private Confessions is an accomplished contribution to rendering visible the artistic quality and complexity of the genre in contemporary culture.

    "biography": "In 1908, Georg Simmel published his Psychologie des Schmuckes (Psychology of Jewelry). The way this great philosopher from Berlin described the egoistic and at the same time altruistic aspects of self-ornamentation is still compelling: “We adorn ourselves for ourselves, and can only do this by adorning ourselves for others,” is a central statement. Simmel categorized different types of jewelry using a scale, according to “how closely the individual types are related to the wearer’s physical personality.” Simmel placed “indigenous people’s intimate jewelry, i.e. tattoos” at the very bottom of the scale, metal and gemstone jewelry at the top, and the diamond at the very top. “Jewelry enhances or augments the aura of a person’s personality by radiating their charisma, as it were,” he wrote. This is why “shiny metals and exquisite gemstones have always been used as jewelry materials, and are ‘adornments’ in a much narrower sense than clothes and hairstyles, which, after all, are also ‘decorative’.” Even if contemporary jewelry designers use far more materials than “shiny metals and exquisite gemstones”, Georg Simmel’s thesis is still in line with the worldwide appreciation that diamond jewelry enjoys. The result of the production process: a HighEnd C Niessing tension ring. 950 platinum, cushion-cut diamond The diamond – called adamas (the unbreakable) by the ancient Greeks – is the hardest material that we know of. And it is, except for a few rare colored gemstones, also the most expensive gemstone. In a piece of jewelry, the stone is held securely by the traditional prong setting. When mounted in what is called a bezel setting, a diamond is completely surrounded by a metal ring, which, however, largely prevents the light from irradiating the lateral and lower facets. A diamond mounted like this is less brilliant. The majority of Niessing’s tension rings incorporate Excellence-cut diamonds, i.e. round brilliant-cut diamonds with 56 facets, plus a flat table.

Like porcelain the pedigree dog hails from ancient China, owning a pug was an imperial prerogative. Carolein Smit, mops met schoentje sculpture, 2016. Ceramics Moreover, in this country there was a secret, aristocratic order of the pug in the form of a porcelain pug. Currently, cats are the stars of the pop cultural avant-garde: cat content rules the internet, design and markets without snobbery. How do artists reflect the constant change in the complex relationship between human and animal that is plainest in pets? The exhibition Cats vs. Dogs at Keramion Frechen displays objects from Jugendstil right up to contemporary art that deal with the image of the animal – from the wild beast to surrogate family or alter ego. Beginning with the fantastic faience dogs in their pyjama-like garb by Émile Gallé from the 1870s, via Beate Kuhn’s cat montages with their typical poses all the way to the various current positions, the complex spectrum of dog and cat motifs in ceramic art is being showcased here. In her installation of dogs walking upright Birgit Saupe addresses genetic manipulation. Conveniently, Anne Kückelhaus&#8217; cat has a hot-water-bottle-neck directly in its belly. And Richard von Haerth shows us defecating dogs, prompting us to reflect on Kleistian gracefulness. Thus we may gain deep insights into animals and ourselves far from the cuteness paradigm.

Born in Bergisch-Gladbach in 1965, Uli Biskup studied jewelry design at Düsseldorf University of Applied Sciences after training as a goldsmith under Thomas and Ilse Dawo. Uli Biskup, tutu_anker necklace. Blackened 925 silver She graduated in 1997, and has been working freelance since 1999. For her tutu series, Biskup interlaces gossamer-fine silver threads to create spatially encompassing structures. Compellingly lightweight and flexible for excellent wearing comfort, the meshwork is ideal for earrings and necklaces. The meshwork is crafted from up to ten threads using precise mathematical specifications. Nevertheless, the result always radiates an eminently natural, gracefully flowing, softly weightless aura. The exhibition at Spandow Gallery, which starts with a summer festival and the vernissage on the first Saturday in September, is the 108th event organized by Helge Mischler, manager of the gallery in Berlin-Spandau. As always, visitors can look forward to enjoying not only exciting jewelry creations, but also live music and artworks created by members of the Brut Interstellar group, such as Betty Boese, Christoph Damm, Christian Ebel and Peter Schlangenbader. o tutu_lilly earrings.

With an exhibition in her atelier, Kathrin Sättele, a jewelry designer from Hildesheim and winner of the Lower Saxony State Award in 2010, will be presenting a retrospective of the winners of this state award in the past 25 years, thus spotlighting “uniquely designed objects and the outstanding handcraftsmanship involved in their creation.” Gabriele Küstner, Mosaic plate.Glass, Ø 36 cm The exhibition will be showing how diverse artistic craftspersons’ concepts are nowadays. Jutta Arndt’s jewelry, for example, features references to antiquity and the Middle Ages, quite in contrast to the minimalist, exquisitely hammered shapes of Kathrin Sättele’s creations and Ulrike Knab’s narrative jewelry. Gabriele Küstner has been creating inventively fused glass mosaics since her days of training, using a technique that was already being practiced by the Romans back in pre-Christian times. Featuring a sleekly modern simplicity, Maike Dahl’s silver utensils remind us of folded paper. Peter Schmitz’s wire meshwork creations are characterized by a compellingly geometrical, transparent corporeity. The pieces crafted by the wood-turner Hans Weissflog testify to his being a virtuoso of filigreed op art. Lucia Schwalenberg’s textiles fascinate us with the unusual haptics of their sculptural textures and structures. Ute Ketelhake uses remnants of certified virgin wool fabrics from the garment industry to create her Second Life Rugs. All these exquisite, artistically crafted products are complemented by photos taken by the industrial photographer Manfred Zimmermann, who also endeavors to highlight the essence of the material concerned in some of his images.

    "biography": "The Textile Museum in St. Gallen is presenting an exhibition of textile jewelry created in the Netherlands and Switzerland. The show, which was previously staged in the Dutch city of Tilburg, spotlights the development of textile jewelry from the 1970s up to the present day. About 50 years ago, the jewelry scene received fresh impetus from young designers, particularly in Holland, England and Germany, who rejected traditional notions and started to use new materials. They crafted jewelry from “worthless” materials, such as plastic, stainless steel and textiles. These sometimes bizarre, sometimes humorously designed or elegant objects disregard the traditional notion of jewelry and override the boundaries between fashion, art and jewelry. In Switzerland, this trend caught on only gradually, but over the course of time has also led to the development of an innovative, distinctive form of art jewelry there. The concept of Body Jewels was conceived by Caroline Boot, the Dutch curator of the show at the TextielMuseum in Tilburg, who illustrates the development of art jewelry in the Netherlands using creations from the museum’s collection. Annina Weber, the curator at the Textile Museum in St. Gallen, complements the Dutch exhibits with Swiss creations that testify to the artists’ in-depth involvement with international trends, as well as to an autonomous development. Juxtaposing the Dutch and Swiss jewelry creations from the past 50 years, she has created a meaningful dialog between the two countries’ scenes. The artists represented include not only renowned Dutch and Swiss jewelry designers, such as Meret Oppenheim, Johanna Dahm and Otto Künzli, but also a number of newcomers like Natalie Luder, who has been covered comprehensively in Art Aurea.

    "biography": "The beginning of Modernism in art and design was inspired by the idea of designing good things. This concept was formulated most clearly at the Bauhaus (1919–1933). A “good” object was sleekly simple and functional. Cover of Art Aurea 27: Model Su with Unita pendant by Corinna Heller. Black rhodanized silver, 8 brilliants. 1.100 €. Photo Laurens Grigoleit Ornamentation and eclecticism were regarded as useless veils and dishonest masquerades. Function alone should determine the aesthetic of houses, rooms and utilitarian objects. This was associated with the effort to offer a better quality of life to all classes of society. The design academy in Ulm (1953–1968) and many other schools of design revived this idea, which remains valid today, as was recently shown by the exhibition Alles ist Design (Everything is Design) at Vitra and at the Bundeskunsthalle in Bonn. But in the meantime, the fundamentals have changed. Never before—at least, not in modern democracies—have individual freedoms been more highly valued than they are today. Formal dictates such as those which Max Bill postulated in 1957 in his book Die gute Form (The Good Form) were already obsolete by the end of the 1960s. People who like playful or ornamental styles can be happy with this. Jewelry artist Gitta Pielcke protests against animal abuse. Photo Ulrike Myrzik (detail) Two billion people inhabited our planet a century ago, but our globe teemed with 7.35 billion humans in 2015. This sheer number compels designers, producers, politicians and all of us to rethink things. Every product made of plastic, which pollutes the oceans, is bad. Whatever cannot be repaired and is used for only a short time is bad. According to a Greenpeace study, two billion pieces of clothing hang unworn or seldom worn in closets and cabinets in Germany alone.

    "biography": "Since 1989, the Foundation for the Gold- and Silversmith’s Art in Schwäbisch Gmünd has appointed a prominent silversmith or jewelry designer every two years to provide fresh impetus for the precious-metal crafts by teaching courses and exhibiting their creations. Paul de Vries in his studio In 2016, the Dutchman Paul de Vries has been honored with this accolade. Schwäbisch Gmünd’s first Goldsmith Laureate was Max Fröhlich from Zurich, followed by Nikolaus Kirchner, Johann Müller, Klaus Eichler, Marianne Schliwinski, Walter Storr, Deganit Stern-Schocken, Berthold Hoffmann, Bettina Maier, Brigitte Moser, Ulrike Knab, Petra Dömmling, Norman Weber, and, most recently, Peter Bauhuis. Paul de Vries loves generously dimensioned objects and silver. “For me, silversmithing is like telling a story that is created by shaping the metal,” he says. The gleam, color, aesthetic appeal and many other characteristics of silver offer him in nite possibilities to explore while crafting his objects with a keen sensitivity for the material. Paul de Vries was born in Mierlo, Netherlands, in 1958. After training at the vocational academy for gold- and silversmiths in Schoonhoven, he first worked as a jeweler in Vancouver. Afterwards, he studied product design at the University of the Arts in Utrecht. Working as a guest lecturer and as a designer, Paul de Vries gained experience on both a national and international level. He lived and worked in New Delhi for three years. At the International Hammer Club Meeting in Schwäbisch Gmünd in 2014, he was awarded the first prize in the In Dialog with Nature competition. As a Goldsmith Laureate, Paul de Vries is now showcasing 21 objects illustrating the oeuvre he’s created over the course of 18 years.

So far, they have held three online auctions. At the upcoming auction from 5 to 8 September 2016, the 4th part of the renowned Hinder collection will be put up for sale, along with creations from other sources. All in all, the auction will be offering 233 items created by German ceramists, including twelve pieces crafted by Bruno and Ingeborg Asshoff (not least a few very early ones), 33 by Dieter Crumbiegel, 22 by Karl and Ursula Scheid and 21 by Wendelin Stahl. On the whole, the estimated prices of the items offered are less than 500 euros. This price level is quite modest judged by international standards. So even less affluent buyers will have a good chance to acquire masterpieces created by German ceramists. After all, designers such as Ingeborg (1919–1998) and Bruno Asshof (1914–2003), Dieter Crumbiegel (*1938), Ursula (1932–2008) and Karl Scheid (*1929), as well as Wendelin Stahl (1922–2000), belong to a generation that accomplished a paradigm shift. Gifted with exceptional artisanal skills and influenced by the developments in modern art, they were focusing on more imaginative decors, more liberated artistic shapes and themes, also creating freeform works of art since the 1960s.

After a work phase from April through the end of June 2016, their creations are now being showcased in an exhibition in the “City of Gold”, and will also be on display in Stuttgart later on this year. Elke Fiebig has developed and produced a small, compact Capsule Wardrobe. The individual garments of this collection can be worn and combined in multiple ways. Elke Fiebig has embraced the slow fashion philosophy, and observes as many aspects of sustainable fashion as possible in her work. Carolina Rebelo Schneider has developed an innovative cane with an integrated seat for senior citizens, which is aesthetically appealing, doesn’t have any stigmatizing connotations, and is a gladly used companion in their everyday lives. Vera Stassen has created jewelry from pieces of black coal that she siliconized herself. Siliconizing serves to stabilize the black coal’s structure. As a result, the originally brittle and blackening rock has the same properties as a gemstone and becomes wearable. During her scholarship fashion designer Elke Fiebig developed a Capsule Wardrobe The Designers in Residence scholarship program was conceived by the Creative Industries department of the Wirtschaft und Stadtmarketing Pforzheim company for the promotion of the city’s economy and image, and called for applications for the first time in 2015. The aim is to boost Pforzheim’s status as a design center. Designers in Residence is targeted at both national and international young design talents in the fields of jewelry, fashion and product design, and awards one scholarship in each of these genres. The creativity center has fully equipped workplaces in its studios for jewelry, fashion and industrial design.

Ceramics in Contemporary Sculpture at Raketenstation Hombroich. Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso and Lucio Fontana used the earthen material just like Grayson Perry, Thomas Schütte and Ai Weiwei do nowadays. Ceramist Robert Sturm in his studio And there’s no reason to appreciate a ceramic material any less than bronze, stone, wood or any other substance that can be used to create art objects. Before being fired, a ceramic material can be easily shaped to conform to a concept, in terms of either form or content, and there’s hardly any limit to the huge variety of possible surfaces and textures, colors and glazes. Moreover, after successful firing, a ceramic creation’s longevity is almost untoppable. So it’s no wonder that ceramic materials are more popular in the art world than almost ever before. Robert Sturm Nevertheless, it’s still quite unusual for an artist who is or was rooted in the ceramics scene to receive proper recognition unbiasedly in the art world. This is why the exhibition entitled Robert Sturm: Ceramic Sculpture 1969–1993 at the Johnen Gallery in Berlin was all the more remarkable. After all, this gallery, managed nowadays by Esther Schipper, ranks among the premier venues for contemporary art in Germany’s capital. The new exhibit at Keramion bases on a collection assembled since the late 1960ies by the founder of the endowment, stoneware producer Dr. Gottfried Cremer from Frechen. Ca. 70 works demonstrate the artistic development of Robert Sturm from the 1960ies to the 1990ies. Robert Sturm, Büste, 1986. 22 x 26 x 16 cm Robert Sturm was a versatile artist with a broad educational background.

    "biography": "Beate Kuhn was a fantastic artist! It is hard to look beyond her unique ceramics, her signature montages of geometrical bodies strung together, developed on the pottery wheel and covered in a sensitive color palette. She had an unparalleled impact on the development of German thrown ceramics after the war when she abandoned utilitarian pottery for free art in the mid-1960s. Her participation in the London Group as well as her membership of Gruppe 83 and AIC are evidence not only of her interest in and commitment to the ceramic development but of her artistic quality. The sheer number of prizes awarded to her underscore the recognition and appreciation she enjoyed. Her musical-artistic parents seem to have almost predestined Beate Kuhn for an artistic career. After completing her studies at Werkkunstschule in Wiesbaden she founded her own workshop in Düdelsheim in 1957, developing a style that was already unmistakably her own. There the artist lived in close vicinity of Karl, Ursula and later Sebastian Scheid in an atmosphere full of productive creativity based on deep friendship. Here her free sculptures were created from single hand-thrown and cut elements, which she assembled into a whole. She transferred this style principle of stringing together geometrical bodies to her designs of large-scale ceramic fountains. Time and again Beate Kuhn developed previously unknown combinations of thrown hollow bodies. Increasingly, her pieces were characterized by a dynamism that expresses motion, rhythm and change. Beate Kuhn’s artistic career was accompanied by enthusiastic collectors who admired her artisan mastery and imagination and continuously marveled at the constantly changing variations of her mounted thrown elements. Hence the artist’s distinctive pieces became sought-after objects that are to be found in every eminent collection. Thinking of Beate Kuhn I also recall the pleasantly modest person who lived for her art, with high expectations of herself, friendly, wi",

    "biography": "Edmund de Waal is a beacon of hope for the applied arts. Seemingly without any effort, this British artist, professor and author transcends boundaries that remain insuperable for most ceramists. His minimalist creations are regularly showcased as art objects. This clearly testifies to the respect he enjoys on the art scene, which usually endeavors to disassociate itself from vessels. In the Dutch Bonnefantenmuseum, his ceramics were exhibited alongside Ai Weiwei’s and Picasso’s creations, and in early 2016, the renowned Gagosian Gallery presented his first solo show in Los Angeles. The Max Hetzler art gallery in Berlin now follows suit with an exhibition of de Waal creations, entitled Irrkunst and presented at two locations until 16 July. The art scene’s appreciation of de Waal is due to the mindset that pervades his work. As the exact opposite of the isolated ceramist who, striving for visual perfection, throws one bowl after another, de Waal is not content with shape alone. Passionately interested in architecture, space and sounds, he needs and wants meaningful content, context, and references to other genres. Also, he always seeks intellectual debate, as is evidenced by his texts, some of which have won an award. In his spatially encompassing installations, he arranges irregularly shaped porcelain objects on shelves and in showcases like notes on sheet music – and also frees them from the status of artisanal objects by surrounding them with a frame. He speaks a language that the art world understands. Repetition, rhythm and references to literature and music are now also on display at the Max Hetzler gallery. De Waal was inspired by none other than Walter Benjamin to showcase his installations there. After all, it was through the philosopher’s texts that the artist first got acquainted with the German capital. The exhibition’s title, Irrkunst, has been derived from Benjamin’s concept of art going astray and the art of noticing what has been lost, what’s being dis",

    "biography": "The two Swiss artists Therese Hilbert and Otto Kuenzli have been creating contemporary jewelry for more than 40 years now. What their creations have in common is their minimalist austerity and the precise craftsmanship involved, plus the radical approach they reveal – particularly the early ones. Kuenzli has often added a dash of conceptualism or a provocative or humorous touch as well, whereas Hilbert has always been and still is engaged in the theme of bodies, or of space surrounded by an exterior shell. Otto Kuenzli, Ring für zwei Personen, 1980. Stainless steel, 2,1 x 12,3 x 0,25 cm This is the first time that the works created by these artists, who were born in Zurich in 1948 and have been living in Munich since the 1970s, are being showcased jointly. In addition to the jewelry they crafted, a number of personal collector’s items, found objects and numerous photographs testify to a richly creative life within the context of family, friends and like-minded people. With this exhibition, the museum is continuing its “&amp;:” series, which it launched in 2009 to spotlight the creative dialog between working groups or partners in the field of design. The “&amp;: Hilbert &amp; Kuenzli” show, however, doesn’t really feature a designer couple, because neither of them has created designs for the industrial sector. They are much rather to be counted among those jewelry makers who, often referred to as auteurs, have been defining jewelry as an autonomous artistic medium since the 1960s. In the second half of the 1960s, they both trained as goldsmiths at what back then was Zurich’s School of Art and Design (and now is Zurich University of the Arts). Just like his German colleagues Karl Schollmayer, Reinhold Reiling, Friedrich Becker or Hermann Jünger at the corresponding educational institutions in Pforzheim, Düsseldorf and Munich, their mutual instructor Max Fröhlich was primarily concerned with shedding the conservative image the goldsmith’s craft had at the time, and di",

    "biography": "Now in its sixteenth edition, Loot: MAD About Jewelry will present a cross-section of exciting, cutting-edge art jewelry designs, and offers the public an opportunity to acquire pieces directly from skilled creators in the field. With the annual exhibit the Museum of Arts and Design in New York promotes designs from international emerging and acclaimed jewelry artists, many of whom have never before shown work in the United States. Forty-four artists from seventeen countries have been invited to participate in this year&#8217;s edition by curator Bryna Pomp after months of travel and research. &#8220;By moving Loot to the spring, we hope to broaden awareness of both this largely underexposed area of jewelry and our invited artists. Retailers and galleries regularly attend; we&#8217;ve launched many careers&#8221;, says Pomp. MAD is the only American museum with a gallery dedicated to the display of both temporary jewelry exhibits and its own collection of contemporary and modern studio and art jewelry. A press preview and walkthrough for the exhibition will be held on Monday April 11, 2016, at 2:30 pm. Proceeds from the sale benefit the Museum&#8217;s exhibition and education programs.

    "biography": "Standing in front of a round table, a young girl was about to set down a bright red bead she had brought along, with her mother. Visitors laid out separate, unthreaded beads in the form of a large pearl necklace. This is a work by Otto Künzli, entitled The Big Family. The girl smiled as she positioned her bead. Then came a couple, each placing a glass ball on the table. The two pieces were connected via the many intervening items. The couple also smiled, as if enjoying seeing the expanding circle. Künzli’s contemporary jewellery was exhibited at the Tokyo Metropolitan Teien Art Museum. One of his works, Der Rote Punkt (The Red Dot) was placed on an outside wall of this 1930s building, formerly an imperial residence. This offers the extra pleasure of reading relationships between an artwork and the space itself. One of Künzli’s newest pieces was inspired by komainu, the guardian lion-dogs that sit on either side of the entrance to this building. People are surprised to hear the turquoise hair Künzli used was taken from a ‘cosplay’ wig for Hatsune Miku, a virtual reality character, bought by the artist in Akihabara. Viewers notice how this work functions as a komainu, guarding the exhibition, and after realizing this, they embark on a reconsideration of the meaning of jewellery. Struck by Künzli’s wit, and shaken by his unconventional modes of expression, we look again at the importance of jewellery. People exiting the museum go back into the throng of Tokyo still talking about Künzli’s work. It is as if a piece of jewellery hung around the city on human bodies, bearing a profound message. Künzli’s art shows that we are part of the world we see around us, even if the various internal relationships may not be visible. It was rare to see an exhibition of contemporary jewellery that offered such intellectual stimulation, especially, if I may say so, in Japan where jewellery is not usually associated with strong messages. The exhibition provided a wonderful source ",

    "biography": "Drinking tea brings people together, whether performed as a family ritual or as a gesture of hospitality, or while enjoying it in the company of friends. Those who offer tea communicate. We visited three very different places in Berlin that all have something in common: tea and the people who love it. Since it moved from the Palais am Festungsgraben in 2012, the Tadshikische Teestube [Tajik Tearoom] has been located in one of the historical buildings of a backyard compound on Oranienburger Strasse in the Berlin-Mitte district. Originally an exhibit at the Leipzig Trade Fair in 1974, it was donated afterwards to the Society of German-Soviet Friendship. The tea and food menu is international, with a focus on Central Asian tea specialties and meals. Olga Schöning, a trained graphic designer and the Tearoom’s owner for almost four years now, had already been designing advertisements for it since the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the traditional Tajik nomad culture, tearooms were reserved for men, who drank their green tea while discussing, negotiating, chatting and smoking hookahs. Elements reminiscent of this lifestyle can also be found in the Tajik Tearoom’s interior in the form of colorful seat cushions, low tables and hand-engraved pillars. Many people think they are made of san- dalwood, but Olga Schöning informs us that “according to an ex- pertise I asked for, it’s poplar.” Giulia Minnucci from Anguillara Sabazia in Italy is spending the afternoon with friends here, enjoying a Russian tea ceremony. They have taken off their shoes, and pour hot water from a samovar onto the tea concentrate in their glasses. The tea can be sweetened with brown or white sugar, and there are pastries, rum raisins, fondant candies and jam. Having a glass of vodka is also part of this ceremony. Giulia particularly likes teas from other countries, which remind her of her journeys, for example of her trip to Egypt with her parents: “We also visited a bedouin camp. The bedouins made three",

    "biography": "Among jewelry’s inherent characteristics are the facts that it closely conforms to the human anatomy and pierces the skin. In addition to this, pieces of jewelry made by the Munich-based goldsmith Gerd Rothmann always bear the physical imprint of a person, e.g. the collector Jan Teunen’s legendary golden nose (1984). The individual signature appears as a fetish with sculptural power. Art Aurea You’ve made jewelry with casts molded from the bodies of the wearers or from other people who are close to you since the 1970s. Where did you get this idea? Gerd Rothmann The desire to include one’s own body in the design is very archetypal and not new. With my casts of people’s body parts, I try to bring something personal and unmistakable into an aesthetic form. The 1970s were characterized by a radical upheaval in the culture of jewelry. My conception of jewelry was also altered by my intensive contacts with trends in the visual arts of that decade. I was searching for greater immediacy. Jewelry without a special connection to the person who wears it or who commissioned it seemed arbitrary and anonymously interchangeable. Casts of body parts such as the ears, nose, mouth, nipples, neck, hands and above all fingerprints became my working material. Art Aurea The 1970s and 1980s were distinguished by a mood of upheaval, and this also included the use of jewelry as an artistic medium. How did you experience this epoch? How would you appraise this phase from today’s perspective? Gerd Rothmann The Academy of Visual Arts in Munich was my inspiring environment in the 1970s. I never attended the Academy as a student, but the spirit radiating from the Academy formatively shaped my viewpoint and attitude toward art. I had to ask myself an existential question: What can I develop from my craft as a goldsmith that can satisfy my aesthetic standards? This led to a declaration of war, so to speak, against the bourgeois jewelry aesthetic. Otto Künzli thought similarly. Together, and in the",

    "biography": "In the pottery world, the concept of simplicity is all too readily associated with functionality: the simplest form makes for optimum utility. Emil Heger’s creations, however, demonstrate that even highly complex, abstract ideas can be self-evidently reified in simple, wheel-thrown shapes and also appeal to our senses. Whereas useful items are usually small and practical, Heger consciously applies the tricks of his trade to craft objects in rather unusual dimensions. Nevertheless, this ceramicist, who was born in 1961, never creates his pieces to merely exemplify his concepts. Quite on the contrary, their exaggerated yet captivating physical presence does not reveal anything of what sparks his love and passion for ceramics time and again. Heger’s transcending the usual dimensions as if in an attempt at liberation makes us realize that this potter works on the borderline between two worlds and two genres. What definitely applies to his work is what the late Walter Popp, one of the greats on the German pottery scene, once said about modernist ceramics: “Ceramic objects are not created from ceramic materials alone&#8230;.” After an apprenticeship in Germany and years of training in Japan, Emil Heger studied at the Institute of Ceramic and Glass Arts in Höhr-Grenzhausen. Fascinated by the phenomenon of a shape’s creation, he asked himself whether it would be possible to present wheel-thrown ceramics in statu nascendi, i.e. to visualize the actual forming process. Although this question didn’t prompt him to “Japanize” his work, this approach was nevertheless influenced by Far-Eastern ceramics. Leaving an object’s shape and any firing marks as they are, as well as tolerating and even cherishing irregularities, is characteristic of Japanese potters – quite contrary to the perfectionism cultivated in Europe. After experimenting with what can be compared to action painting – dripping glazes on wheel-thrown rod-shaped vessels –, Heger developed tall tube-, spindle- and bulb-s",

    "biography": "Christof Lungwitz and his wife, a physiotherapist, live in the picturesque town of Leichlingen near Düsseldorf, in a house perched on a hillside and fitted with mahogany doors, mosaics, etc. “At first, I had a screaming fit,” remembers this minimalist, who was born in Weimar in 1948. But meanwhile he enjoys living amongst these things. “I am living a contradiction,” he says. For several years now, he has been designing puristic objects with names such as “Bowl for Ideas” or “Angular Tray for a Shyster”. He intuitively comes up with these poetic names while working on an object. Lungwitz made a name for himself in the 1990s with his limewood cabinet, whose top elements feature the naturally grown irregularities of the original tree trunk. Almost every day, he descends from his office in the attic to his machines in the basement. His tidy workshop is small, and the shelf units at the walls, filled with tools, different types of timber and collected objects, almost reach the ceiling. His melancholic eyes sparkle with enthusiasm when he thinks of his next project: “chamber of wonders cabinets – I already have the objects that I want to put into them.” (Read on below) To Christof Lungwitz&#8217;s profilewith further objects This avid collector has developed a fervent passion for combining curiosities that originally don’t belong together, also in the form of still lifes. This focus on the figurative – also in smaller formats – will no doubt be something new for connoisseurs of Lungwitz’s work. A platter featuring an arrangement of wooden objects that he painted in white – a cactus, a pear and a few apples – testifies to his new predilection. He also collects toys, and his latest purchase is an old dollhouse. Do we go back to our childhood when we grow old? “To some extent, yes. My father, a sculptor, was rarely at home, and we had hardly any toys.” He points to a few books about his father, whose covers he helped to create. “His creations can be found in many public plac",

Bus stop by Rintala Eggertsson, Norway, in Bregenzerwald, Austria The projects on show have been created for a wide variety of purposes. The spectrum ranges from the creatively designed bus shelters recently erected in the Bregenz Forest, plus boathouses and houseboats, beach sheds and changing cubicles all the way through to gazebos and canopies. It also includes objects created by artists who explored the theme of “space”, such as the glass creations crafted by Pauline Betin from France, for example. Michael Cleff from Bochum will be showcasing his ceramic objects inspired by architecture. On Addition ceramic sculpture inspired by architecture, created by Michael Cleff Suspended House, glass object created by Pauline Betin exploring the theme of space Christoph Leuner, a master cabinetmaker from Garmisch, will be represented with his dismantable garden lounge, developed in collaboration with his wife, the ceramist Stefanie Borchard-Leuner, and the textile designer Katja Stelz, for the A Little Paradise exhibition at Galerie Handwerk.

    "biography": "Born in 1935, Peter Skubic has numbered among the most important figures in contemporary art jewelry since the 1970s. For an exhibition at the Pinakothek der Moderne in 2011, he was quoted as having said that making jewelry is “an experiment, a sculptural or performative statement, a bodily activity, the crossing of a boundary, and a creative act of liberation.” Peter Skubic, brooch, 2010. Stainless steel, lacquer, sheet gold This Austrian jewelry maker participated in the Body Alchemy exhibition in Hangzhou, China in 2015. Now at the Munich Jewelry Week 2016, his angular and radically minimalistic pieces are on display at Gallery Isabella Hund. A new series, which he entitled nothing behind, features glossy plates of stainless steel pierced with round or elongated oval holes. “My doctor insisted that I had to swallow some pills, and afterwards I was inspired by their empty packages,” the artist explains. The brooches are a variant of his invisible theme. Clarifying his quality criteria as curator of the special Jewelry 2016 show at the Crafts Fair, Peter Skubic says,“I prefer crossover artists to boring traditionalists and I’ve favored jewelry artists whose views are similar to mine. I didn’t consider decorative, nice, pretty jewelry. After all, it’s a difficult task to choose fewer than 10% of the 720 applicants to participate in Jewelry 2016. Basically, it’s very unfair.”",

Never before have so many designers studied, worked and lived in foreign countries as nowadays. Art and designer objects are showcased and sold all over the world. What’s the result of this? An indistinct tangle of formal idioms where national and individual identities become well-nigh indistinguishable? With its keynote theme of Dialogs, the spring 2016 issue of Art Aurea will be showcasing counter-examples. For many eminent contemporary artists and designers, dialogs with foreign cultures or their own history are a fertile source of inspiration – just like at the beginning of the modern era. Below, you’ll find a few impressions from the new issue, which will be available at train station kiosks and leading jewelry and applied arts galleries as of February 9, 2016.

Hanau’s City GoldsmithFrozen necklace\">Frozen necklace\">Sam Tho Duong, Frozen necklace After training as a goldsmith in Pforzheim, Duong attended the city’s Hochschule für Gestaltung, where he earned his diploma in 2002. His repertoire includes brooches and space-encompassing jewelry for the body and the neck. Sam Tho Duong primarily became well known for the pieces in his Frozen series, which feature freshwater rice pearls. While in Hanau, Sam Tho Duong turned his attention to the Grimm Brothers, who were born there and to whom he dedicated an artwork in the shape of two hats. A jury in Hanau has named a “city goldsmith” every two years since 2004. Each goldsmith spends six weeks at the Staatliche Zeichenakademie, where he or she offers a workshop. The selection of the city goldsmith, which is overseen by the Gesellschaft für Goldschmiedekunst e.V., also includes a solo exhibition at the Deutsches Goldschmiedehaus. The project is financed by the city of Hanau. In 2004, Hanau’s first city goldsmith was the gold- and silversmith Rudolf Bott. The honor was given to the Japanese jewelry artist Jiro Kamata in 2006. Jurors chose the Belgian artist Hilde De Decker as the first woman “city goldsmith” in 2008. She was followed in 2010 by Karl Fritsch, who resides alternately in Germany and New Zealand, and by Vera Siemund from Hamburg in 2012. Text Christianne Weber-Stöber Photos Petra Jaschke",

    "biography": "Since the time of the De Stijl and the Bauhaus movements many artists and designers from the Netherlands cultivate reduced shapes. Bernard Heesen&#8217;s work obviously represents a counterpoint of these constructivist, reduced forms. The clear form is not for the artist, who was born in the Dutch city of Leerdam in 1958. Rather, he is known as something of an anarchist in glass art. With the force of a titan he labours in his workshop de oude Horn in Acquoy, close to the city of his birth, on the hot, viscous material. Driven by unfettered curiosity and an eagerness to experiment he creates expressionist objects of glass. At first glance they appear to satisfy merely a desire for baroque opulence. Yet even if Bernard Heesen draws inspiration from 19th century encyclopedias for many of his recent works, there is still another element to it. Contrary to the systematically ordered flourishes and volutes of his historical models his pieces hold a nonchalant playfulness and moments of the absurd or surreal. The glass artist also demonstrated his spontaneous joy of experimentation when he discovered the work of Heer Jeekel (1839–1885). The glass manufacturer and mayor of Leerdam produced an early version of industrial moulded glass. Without hesitation Heesen took up the technique. Yet he also used second-hand glass, which he found at flea-markets or in attics, to integrate into his pieces by means of silicon glue. What was it that sparked your interest in glass in the first place? Bernard Heesen In the beginning, although my father was a famous glass designer for the Royal Leerdam glass factory, I was not interested in glass at all. While I was studying architecture my father started his own hot glass studio and there I saw the hot glass for the very first time. I was intrigued by this strange material: hot, liquid and transparent, completely the opposite of the cold and rigid glass everyone knows. Not trained as a glassblower I started to explore the qualities of this s",

Renate Breuß: Our common goal was to enhance the quality of artisanal products and to foster collaboration and mutual feedback. For this purpose, the artisans established an association in 1999 to promote their trades to the public through exhibitions, competitions and lectures, and between themselves through development and youth work. Built by innovative craftspersons, the edifice reflects their own individual mindsets and styles, which fit seamlessly in with the Vorarlberg region’s distinctive architecture. Their desire for continuity and strong local roots is also manifested in the Werkraum building in Andelsbuch. AA: How did it come about that modernist ideas have taken root so impressively in the Bregenz Forest of all places? RB: Not only have architects and craftspersons developed a heightened sensibility, the general public has also changed its perceptual habits over the years. The people commission products from local artisans, and are open to new developments and exemplary refurbishing. Awards for competitions such as Handwerk+Form (Crafts+Design) also play an important role. A traditionally strong sense of community, as well as a mindset that considers design not only as superfluous embellishment, can also be perceived in a refined cuisine and dining culture, or in a creative approach to language and music. AA: How did you become manager of Werkraum Bregenzerwald? What are your most important goals in this post? RB: I grew into this job working as an art historian.

    "biography": "What can one give as a gift to one’s loved ones at a time when a few people have more than enough possessions, while other people have very little? Giving alms to the poor is one possibility. Another option is to give art and design objects that preserve their value—or grow more valuable—with the passage of time. We suggest both: each is meaningful, each lastingly gives joy, and each helps to preserve and enrich our culture. The following suggestions result from our latest call for submissions. Kuhnstücke Ottilienhof 1, 73728 Esslingen, DE, kuhnstuecke.de Kuhnstücke, Ring. 999 fine goldLothar Kuhn, the owner of Kuhnstücke, Esslingen, during the forging process Lothar Kuhn explains that this fine gold ring, which is crafted in his own atelier, embodies “a piece of infinity.” A wrought surface of pure 999 gold creates this ring’s special aura. Six windings, which look like an endless band, convey a sense of harmony and a sculptural quality, even when the ring isn’t being worn.“We’re passionate goldsmiths and we have a distinctive style, which we continually recheck and evolve. Love for craftsmanship and the raw materials is the essential basis, says this master goldsmith, who adds, “Our Canny Pieces are conceived and fabricated for our clientele right here in Esslingen.” First-rate handcraftsmanship goes without saying for each of his goldsmiths. Increasingly many of his customers want to have “their” own personal jewelry—unique pieces made expressly for each individual. “A role is also played by the fact that my colleagues have worked here in our atelier for a long time and are able to live their work.” Barbara Schulte-Hengesbach Schmuck Neubrückstrasse 4, 40213 Düsseldorf, DE, schulte-hengesbach.com &nbsp; Gallerist and designer Barbara Schulte-HengesbachSternschnuppe ring. 750 gold, diamond\">Sternschnuppe ring. 750 gold, diamond\">Barbara Schulte-Hengesbach, Sternschnuppe ring. 750 gold, diamond Barbara Schulte-Hengesbach’s kinetic ring Sternschnuppe [Falling Star] ",

    "biography": "The Turkish ceramist Ipek Kotan has been living in the Occident for two decades now, creating minimalist vessels that perpetuate Oriental traditions. The artist is a member of formforum Switzerland. Art Aurea Your work stems from a visceral need to create with your hands, you say. Ipek Kotan I feel most fulfilled when I lose myself in materials, textures, forms, colors, proportions and details. Working with my hands is not only an urge but central to my existence. I’ve tried jobs in the past, before starting my work with ceramics, where I worked in offices and wore suits. But denying myself the pleasure of getting my hands dirty and creating objects made me miserable. AA The second important thing for you is the deep connection to the vessel form. IK The connection to the vessel form comes from having grown up in Turkey where from an early age I was exposed to archeology. Since then I’ve had the chance to live in different parts of the world and the more places I saw, the more I realized that humans, no matter where they live or what era they live in, have more similarities than differences. Vessels being one of the oldest and most commonly discovered objects in archeological sites the world over is to me evidence of the universality of the human experience. The vessel has been around for at least 30,000 years. Both in a metaphysical and pragmatic sense it is so tightly woven into the story of humankind. I can’t think of a better object to use as the foundation of my work to show that we are all connected and part of a much bigger picture. AA You strive to perfect every detail in your vessels. IK One of my earliest memories is my mother dressing me when I was very little. First she would put my clothes on and then at the end my socks. If the stitchings of the socks weren’t perfectly aligned with my toes, I would have to adjust and correct them. So I think the need for perfection and attention to detail were always there, I just chose to channel these qualities in an",

    "biography": "This year, on November 14 and 15, the Kulturhaus (House of Culture) in Mestlin, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, will be hosting what is already the fourth hinterland sales exhibition, which serves well-known studios located within and beyond the region’s borders as a platform for showcasing their works – starting from individually designed creations to exquisite arts and crafts products. The House of Culture was acknowledged as a monument of national importance by the Federal Government in 2011. It was built in the 1950s as the cultural center of the socialist model village of Mestlin. The exhibition&#8217;s initiators, Ute Dreist and Birgit Hasse, answered our questions. The hinterland exhibition breathes new life into Mestlin’s House of Culture. Art Aurea The Socialist Unity Party built the Houses of Culture for the education and enlightenment of East Germany’s rural population, something that also included entertainment and sociable get-togethers. In view of its comprehensive fringe program, the hinterland exhibition is pretty much in line with the original ideas. Ute Dreist The house still has the 400-m2 auditorium with excellent acoustics and an orchestra pit. When I was a pupil, I attended performances staging fairy-tales here. There was also a cinema, a library, a lecture hall, a registrar’s office, rooms for leisure activities, a restaurant and a dance hall. It was a vibrantly alive place, even if it was organized “from above”. After Germany’s Reunification, the House of Culture lost its sponsors, and the building’s condition deteriorated quite severely. But Mecklenburg is a wonderful region and has attracted enthusiastic people with a lot of ideas and visions. For several years now, the Denkmal Kultur Mestlin (Cultural Monument Mestlin) association has been organizing contemporary art exhibitions, an annual theater project, round-table discussions, harvest festivals and concerts. The House of Culture is also one of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Music Festival’s venues",

One of the first photos shows him clad in leather and showing off his bare, hairy chest sporting a huge pendant. In addition to portraits of this Dutch artist, the Google search results also include photos of his jewelry: colorful, unusual, sometimes flashy, but usually characterized by clear-cut forms and shapes. His Exchange ring from the 1970s is meanwhile considered a classic, and his phallic Face pendant a guarantor of people’s attention. When he creates his jewelry, which is quite often inspired by politics, everyday objects and fashion, Derrez is not striving for perfect harmony. “I find it a lot more exciting when things connote dissonance, the rough edges of society,” he says.

There’s a lot of meaningful content behind his creations’ gaudy aesthetics, or, more precisely, they’re a fruitful combination of artistic potential and smart business sense. Long before he was recognized internationally as an artist, he had made name for himself with his Galerie Ra, which opened in 1976 in Amsterdam as one of the world’s first avant-garde jewelry galleries. Here he regularly showcases objects, vessels and jewelry created by the approximately 50 artists he represents. It’s not surprising that he and his partner, Willem Hoogstede, also collect and wear jewelry in their private lives. In addition, he has a predilection for items of practical utility, preferab",

Three years after she passed away, her family and friends set up the Françoise van den Bosch Foundation, which celebrates its 35th anniversary in 2015.

    "biography": "30 years ago, an art magazine of a different kind was brought to life – for art jewelry, ceramic art and other artisanal art forms, as well as designer objects. The keynote topic of Art Aurea’s anniversary issue is “Gifting culture – how we can imbue the act of giving with new meaning”. More than any other work of art or designer object, a piece of jewelry is a perfect gift, and even ranks among the most sustainable cultural objects ever made. Unlike historical jewelry, contemporary pieces are not created to convey prestige and status. Instead, since the Art Nouveau period, jewelry crafted by artists or in authentic ateliers and manufactories has evolved into a means for people to express their personality – something that Laurens Grigoleit from Munich impressively demonstrates in the photos he took of arrestingly distinctive women from different cultural backgrounds. We are convinced that our readers will appreciate the fact that none of them is a professional model. The “Gifting culture” topic also inspired ten gallerists and shop owners, who each selected one object to be spotlighted in Art Aurea’s anniversary issue and whose comments convincingly explain how a product is imbued with cultural relevance. Culturally relevant objects can also be found in vintage shops and at design and art fairs, such as the design classic düsseldorf (29 November, 2015), the Cologne Fine Art (18–22 November 2015) and the design.Börse Berlin (22–24 January 2016), as well as at the relevant auctions, such as those covered in Art Aurea’s current issue. Ceramics by Ipek KotanPortrait of Christof Lungwitz In addition, we have dedicated three major portraits to three very different designers, who have one thing in common – a lot of passion for their work and consummate virtuosity in terms of craftsmanship: Christof Lungwitz, who crafts superbly designed wooden objects, Ipek Kotan, who creates highly impressive vessels from Limoges porcelain, and Reinhard Scheuble, who publishes exquisitel",

    "biography": "Morten Lobner Espersen. Photo Christian Yde Frostholm Art Aurea What was it that sparked your interest in ceramics in the first place? Morten Løbner Espersen I always liked to draw and paint as a kid, but when I as a teenager did my first night class in ceramics, I realized that working with a three dimensional material was so much more rewarding for me. AA Did you have any role models? And, if so, who influenced you most? MLE I have had many along the way, my grandfather who painted and encouraged me to do the same, my first teacher in clay, who taught me to just keep on centring the lump of clay even when results seemed far away. Some teachers and various artists that took my breath away: Bernard Pallisy, Aksel Salto, Hans Cooper, George Ohr among others. AA For a long time, you created eminently clear-cut, unsophisticated shapes that served you as a kind of canvas for your complex, multi-layered glazes. Do you want these objects to be regarded as works of art, or should they rather be used primarily in everyday life, for example as flower vases? MLE To me works of art are many things. Maybe all human attempts to make art is art. It is very important for me however to make a distinction between poor art and great art. My cylindrical vessels are art works – with or without flowers. Function as such doesn’t remove the artistic dimension. Lack of quality does. AA You say that you risk an object’s complete destruction by your glazes. Why? MLE I do it to obtain true beauty. When I strive to make a large complex surface and vibrant colours in my work, I often re-fire my work, trying to achieve that extra depth, the magic. But clay can suffer technically from several firings and at some point the vessel break. I take this risk because no result is better than a mediocre one. Morten Lobner Espersen, ceramics.

    "biography": "Tall structure Bowl with ammonite print Lotte Reimers, who was born in Hamburg in 1932, epitomizes virtues that distinguish any exceptional personality. This ceramist is humble and quiet, yet at the same time fully aware of her extraordinary status as an artist. “It’s too bad that we all have to leave this world eventually … but I’m grateful and happy for having been able to create ceramics for more than 50 years now,” are her introductory remarks in the catalog that was published to accompany this exhibition and which she refers to as “an illustrated broadsheet from the year 2014”. Let’s hope that this “eventually” still takes a long time in coming, because the new vessels Reimers created in 2014 – fifty altogether – are not only a feast for the beholder’s eye, but also an eminently valuable contribution to contemporary ceramics, especially in Germany. Tall open form on oval base Tall open form on oval base Narrow-necked form on oval base Bell-shaped form on rectangular base Nevertheless, most of these creations look familiar when compared to her previous oeuvre. Their shapes: not thrown on the wheel but molded by hand; symmetrical, heavy, and with stepped outlines; some opening up towards the top, others featuring a narrow opening with irregular edges, and yet others with tubular protrusions like termite mounds. Or their glazes: in earthy green, brown and ochre hues that either overlap or sharply intersect, or form gently flowing transitions. All these are well-known features, just like the dotted surfaces that bridge the gap to the Aborigines in Australia, whose paintings Reimers has collected. This ceramist, who lives in the wine town of Deidesheim, is not really into radical disjunctions, but much rather into continuity – which is not untypical for her genre. Nonetheless, her oeuvre testifies to perfectly perceptible changes and developments. They’re not easy to describe in detail, because they’re related to an inherently subconscious emotion that can perhaps b",

This situation changed in 1968 thanks to an exhibition at Henry Rothschild’s Primavera Gallery in London. The show featured works by Margarete Schott, Ursula and Karl Scheid, Beate Kuhn, and Gotlind and Gerald Weigel. The event was a tremendous success and the participants afterwards presented their ceramics under the name London Group in a series of subsequent exhibitions, for example, at Galerie Rosemarie Jäger. Gerald WeigelGotlind Weigel Beate Kuhn Now a small retrospective of their works from the estate of Eva and Hansgeorg Gareis will be shown. Over many decades, Mr and Mrs Gareis collected ceramics and maintained friendly relations with the ceramists of the London Group, assembling artworks mainly from the 1970s to the 1990s. Their great commitment to ceramics made possible a series of international exhibitions Form und Glasur at the Jahrhunderthalle of Hoechst AG. Margarete SchottKarl Scheid In the Kabinett, photos by Karl Scheid show his view of nature and ceramics.

When Kathrin Sättele, who was born in 1967, creates her jewelry, everything revolves around the hammering process. And her native city of Hildesheim is the pivotal point of her life. After she had trained as a goldsmith from 1986 to 1990, she studied at Hildesheim’s University of Applied Sciences and Arts, graduated in 1998 and has been working freelance at Heinrichstrasse 26 ever since. And since back then – when Sättele hadn’t finished her studies yet – she has set up a respectable studio-cum-exhibition room in the former joiner’s workshop, which she at first shared with up to 18 fellow students. Unfortunately, she doesn’t own the property, this goldsmith regrets, “But I always act as if I do. And usually, my landlord likes my ideas for modification and supports me or just lets me do my thing.” What Are We Doing Here?! exhibition series.\">What Are We Doing Here?! exhibition series.\">Kathrin Sättele’s gallery space: starting on September 6, artistically crafted creations can be admired here within the context of the What Are We Doing Here?! exhibition series.Kathrin Sättele’s studio will not only be showcasing artistically crafted objects, but also serve as a venue for musical events and literary readings. In September 2014, Kathrin Sättele participated for the first time in the event entitled Hinten im Hof (In the Backyard), for which ten other participants also opened their doors to the public. For Sättele, this had been the incentive to finally finish the exhibition room, where she also wants to present small yet exquisite exhibitions in the future. “Despite this location, i.e. in the Hildesheim’s northern district, I believe in the concept of holding ex",

A total of sixteen ART AUREA AWARDS, including three first prizes, were conferred in eleven disciplines this year. Jan Kath won 34 votes in the category of carpets / interior textiles. Miriam Hiller got 18 votes in the category of art jewelry, where the field of competitors was significantly larger. And studio glassmaker Tora Urup, who received 17 votes, was the most successful designer in the category of container culture. It is for such glass art that the danish Designer received the main prize in the area Studioglass of the ART AUREA AWARDS 2015. Tora Urup, Bowl.

    "biography": "Ian Meares, vessel There are countless reasons to look forward to summer. For many people who love ceramics, the International Ceramic Days in Oldenburg are one such reason. On the first weekend of August in each of the past 33 years, this event has attracted the “who’s who” of the international ceramic scene to the ducal palace in the city’s center. A traditional highlight is the ceramic market on Schlossplatz: this year, works will be on display by 124 masters of the ceramic art from 14 countries who were chosen by a jury from over 350 candidates. Collectors and aficionados of ceramics from around the world will find a choice selection ranging from artistic objects to high-quality crockery for daily use. Lectures, workshops, conferrals of awards and exhibitions round out the event. Special highlights include cost-free special shows in the baroque setting of the palace. On July 31st, i.e. the day before the market, the Ceramist Portrait takes place at the Werkschule in Oldenburg, Hochheider Weg 169. Interested visitors will have the opportunity to meet lesser-known ceramists here. This year’s focus is on Prof. Marc Leuthold und Ian Meares, two renowned ceramic artists from the USA. Most exhibitions don’t show the how, i.e. the special ways of working and techniques, but precisely these practical aspects will be the topics of the Masterclass workshop led by the two ceramists at the Werkschule on July 30th. div\" data-cycle-allow-wrap=true data-cycle-auto-height=container data-cycle-carousel-offset=20 data-cycle-carousel-paged=false data-cycle-carousel-filmstrip=false data-cycle-caption=\"#gallery_686ccc8ec3c90 .count\" data-cycle-caption-template=\"{{slideNum}} | {{slideCount}}\" data-cycle-overlay=\"#gallery_686ccc8ec3c90 .caption\" data-cycle-overlay-template=\"{{cycleTitle}}\">Apocalypse Mitosis, 2013.

    "biography": "Art Aurea, which can be translated as “Golden Art,” was first born in 1985 from my enthusiasm for art jewelry, which was nearly unknown at that time and which was undergoing a courageous and radical break with tradition in those years. As editor-in-chief of a special-interest magazine for watches and industrial jewelry at Ebner Publishers in Ulm, I chanced to visit a jewelry exhibition in an art gallery in the summer of 1985. The exhibit featured works by the goldsmith Jan Dix, who is the son of the painter Otto Dix, and by another goldsmith, Barbara Plersch, who showed her expressive pieces in silver with acrylic and colored lacquer. Also in their sheer dimensions, her works differed fundamentally from conventional industrial jewelry. Chief Editor and Publisher of Art Aurea, Reinhold Ludwig, with brooch by Francesco Pavan, silver, enamel, Rosemarie Jäger gallery. Photo Miriam Künzli At approximately the same time, goldsmiths in Munich were seeking a publisher for a magazine that was to be published to accompany a jewelry exhibition in Künstlerhaus am Lenbachplatz. Among other places, they also landed in my office. I’ve always enjoyed jumping into cold water without a backward glance, so I let their enthusiasm persuade me and I agreed to create the magazine. I was assisted in this project by Stanislaus Kutác, a designer from Ulm who had studied at the technical college in Schwäbisch Gmünd and was familiar with Professor Pierre Slevogt’s jewelry class. In retrospect, Kutác’s most imaginative design contribution to Art Aurea was a black-and-white dotted pattern on the back of the magazine and the inside of its cover. The pattern was taken from a shirt that he inserted into a photocopier. Copies of Art Aurea were literally snatched from our hands at the exhibition in Munich in November 1985. The success was so overwhelming that we dared to publish the magazine quarterly and soon afterwards bilingually in German and English. Art Aurea demanded plenty of heart’s blood! I",

    "biography": "Paul Derrez, 2013 Art Aurea Representing the artists showcased in your Galerie Ra, you had been exhibiting at the Collect fair in London for many years. Why not this year? Paul Derrez Galerie Ra didn’t participate this year, because the past few years weren’t successful enough, and it’s also very stressful and expensive to attend this show. To make up for London, we made our first appearance at the Rotterdam Contemporary Art Fair in February. This was a very pleasant and successful experience, as was the Frame show within the context of Munich’s International Crafts Fair this year, which was extremely successful for us. We’ll also be exhibiting at KunstRai in Amsterdam from May 27–31. This art fair has always been a very good platform for us. And in November, Ra will be showcasing books at the Sieraad Art Fair in Amsterdam. Paul Derrez, Confetti necklace, 2012. Silver, acrylic Art Aurea Galerie Ra has been one of the world’s first galleries for avant-garde jewelry. In addition, you have always been working as an artist. How do you combine the two activities? Paul Derrez Amsterdam’s Sieraad Gallery (1969–1975), where I worked as an intern, closed as a result of this conflict of priorities. When I opened Ra in 1976, I decided that the gallery should always be my first priority. I also opted for a neutral name that doesn’t evoke associations with a workshop-cum-gallery. This decision made it easier for me to not be working in my workshop during certain periods. This is how, with discipline and enjoyment, I built up what I consider a rather nice oeuvre over the course of the years, which includes both my public work in the gallery and my own creations as the result of my private work.

Three people working together for 13 years in the same room, and before that working together in a much smaller room, during their studies. But all the time working separately too, the position of the individual work could not be more disparate: in Yutaka’s case the meticulous reduction of a single material to a perfect form, in David’s case the transformation of exactly the right material in the pursuit of a instantly recognizable figurative picture, and in my case the obsessive, complex construction, both theoretically and practically, of heterogeneous worlds. Three very different cultures, three very different educations. Each has always pursued an authentic private vision, having built their practice in a time before the global explosion of contemporary art jewellery, and the age of style surfing and the quick fix. Despite or perhaps because of these contrasts there are threads that run through, the foreignness of each to the other a strong facination, as are the shared interests; cooking, collecting, music. And of course sharing a space making this kind of work is also sharing a life, now almost 20 years of life as foreign jewellers in Germany. Not at all surprizing that they can call this show The Bride, The Groom and The Best Man. Text Helen Britton",

    "biography": "Isa Genzken, Schauspieler (actors) installation, 2014 Mysterious compositions made of mannequins, garments and unusual props are what visitors currently encounter at Frankfurt’s Museum of Modern Art. Isa Genzken, born in Bad Oldesloe in 1948 and one of the most influential contemporary artists, is showcasing her latest creations under the title of New Works. The well-balanced aesthetics of this body of work created in 2014 and 2015 – after her Retrospective was shown in New York – is intriguing, reveals modern consumer habits, leaves many questions unanswered and has a disturbing effect. What kind of strange interaction is going on between the rigid protagonists that silently form a circle? What kind of social structure is being highlighted here? If it’s indeed supposed to be a social group, then each member represents a different aspect of our sometimes absurd world. The children’s figures wear oversized shoes, some of the other protagonists feature naked parts of their bodies that people in the Western world prefer not to expose in public. Some of the garments are pieces once worn by the artist. One of the figures, sporting a mask, a headgear and football shoulder pads, looks as if it were desperate to protect itself. But from what? Maybe from the powers that other protagonists have already gagged with garish adhesive tape. The fact that one of the mannequins lies on the floor, with its lower body naked and its genitals sprayed in red, supports the interpretation that what visitors are witnessing here are scenarios of heteronomy, helplessness and alienation. Are they all dramatic presentations of real threats? For Genzken, who was married to the painter Gerhard Richter until 1993, this exhibition comprising 40 figures, as well as several floor and wall installations, represents both a reflection upon our present time and her own biography.

Photo Martin Adam © Holz collection\">Carlo Scarpa, vase Battuto, 1940. Made by Venini. Photo Martin Adam © Holz collection The retrospective starts with the 1930s, when the Italian architect Carlo Scarpa had a significant influence on the development of a revolutionary new language of form and design in Murano’s workshops, using long-forgotten techniques, such as the battuto and inciso cutting techniques, to craft vases and bowls. In addition, he used opaque pulegoso glass, as well as murrine made of fused colored glass canes as materials. After World War II, artists such as Fulvio Bianconi, Ercole Barovier and Flavio Poli contributed to a new boom, so Murano attracted other international artists. Masterpieces perpetuating the tradition of Murano studio glass are still being created nowadays, for example by Monica Guggisberg/Philip Baldwin (Switzerland/USA), Yoichi Ohira (Japan), Mary Ann Toots Zynsky (USA) and Thomas Blank (Switzerland). The Bellerive Museum will be showcasing about 300 glass objects crafted either in glass manufactories in Murano or in individual artists’ studios. Battuto, 2005.

Then the International Fair for Applied Arts and Design is the right place for you. In Karlsruhe’s exhibition halls in the neighboring town of Rheinstetten, you’ll have the opportunity to experience a different way of shopping and choose what you fancy from an almost infinite variety of exquisite arts and crafts products, one-of-a-kind pieces and small series created by more than 350 artisans and designers from about 20 nations. Below you’ll find a few examples from our Showroom section that we think might inspire you. Claudia Biehne Leipzig, Germany / biehne-porzellan.de / Eunique Stand B.57 The porcelain studio of Claudia Biehne &amp; Stefan Passig Porcelain from Leipzig’s Cotton Mill – The Continent’s largest cotton mill was operated in Leipzig at the beginning of the 20th century. After deindustrialization, the premises have primarily been used for ateliers and galleries since the early 1990s. Artists like Neo Rauch numbered among the first to discover this venue’s special atmosphere. Nowadays art-loving visitors from around the world find a complete factory city that has preserved much of its character from its nascent years between 1884 and 1907. In recognition of the cotton mill’s exhibitions and open workshops, England’s The Guardian newspaper named it “the hottest place on Earth.” The temperature in the porcelain atelier that Claudia Biehne shares with her partner Stefan Passig can become quite hot indeed when she fires the delicately translucent objects in her Lumos series or her dynamically massive Vulcanoids. Born in Leipzig in 1974, Biehne loves to experiment, a character trait which ensures that every visit to her atelier will be a worthwhile experience.

    "biography": "Helen W. Drutt English The late Russian poet Joseph Brodsky, who combined our worlds, stated in an essay “&#8230;. That in the course of this life every person sooner or later finds himself in the position of Robinson Crusoe, carving notches and &#8230; crossing them out. Such is the origin of ornament, regardless of preceding civilizations … and these notches are a profoundly solitary activity isolating the individual and forcing him toward an understanding &#8230; of the autonomy of his existence in the world.” It is within one of these notches that contemporary artists share a mission to strengthen art, society, and create works responsive to our time. We can only hope that the art created by these individuals will not fail to reach out and satisfy greater aesthetic and political needs. These works, which engage one another, provide a dialogue and merge creative and diplomatic expression. Since that symbolic gesture is physically impossible, the aim of “Gifts from America” is that the artworks will provide a catalyst for all and an exchange of ideas that serves as a bridge to bring our lives together. This initiative was born during a meeting with Tamara Rappe and Dr. Mikhail Piotrovsky at the Hermitage Museum in December 2012. The concept of a selection of a few gifts of American crafts developed into the present exhibition of seventy-four works collected from February to October 2013. A special thank you to Tamara Rappe and her assistant Vera Emelyanova for their understanding and patience during this period. No exhibition can occur without the existence of a community. The enthusiastic response of the artists and patrons made the concept a reality and is deeply appreciated – without their support there would be no Gifts from America. I would like to thank Paul and Chauncie Rodzianko, directors of the Hermitage Foundation, New York who lent spirited support to this initiative. In addition, my deepest appreciation to Mihai Burlacu, my assistant, whose immeasurab",

    "biography": "Sculpture, 2014 He is an “elemental force” in his craft and one of the most important potters on France’s – if not Europe’s – ceramics scene. His name is legendary: Claude Champy. Like hardly any other, the oeuvre of this potter extraordinaire, who was born in 1944, represents a powerfully dynamic process of creating wheel-thrown, glazed and wood-fired vessels, as well as sculpted vessel-like objects and picture-like murals inspired by geological formations and the results of erosion. Claude Champy Nevertheless, despite their often gigantic dimensions and what looks like the outcome of violence involved in the crafting process, such as burst surfaces, burred rims and edges, light-colored glazes poured on midnight-black surfaces, his creations reveal all the subtlety of ceramic sophistication and even delectable delicacy. In these masterfully crafted compositions, experience and skill have been inimitably wedded to nonchalance and spontaneity. After a long interval, works by this French grandmaster can be seen again in Germany: Marianne Heller will be showcasing Claude Champy’s creations in her gallery in Heidelberg from April 19 through June 14, 2015.

Agate Lustrous and colorful, hard and imperishable: stones have piqued people’s interest since the early days of human history, when hunters and gatherers, our early ancestors, interpreted them as gifts from the gods and attributed healing and protective powers to them – and used them as jewelry. Over the course of cultural history, people have changed their notions and interpretations of them. Precious stones appeared in legends and fairy tales, and were incorporated in the crowns of aristocrats and the jewelry of wealthy citizens. They became status symbols, an economic factor and the subject of scientific research. In our day and age, precious stones continue to play an important role as jewelry elements or investments. In contrast to conventional gem-studded jewelry, which features gemstones in classical cuts and arranged in repetitive patterns, contemporary jewelry artists are using their own individual techniques to restore the magic of gemstones. Petr Dvorak, earrings. Agate Some of the Forgotten Stones showcased at Eva Maisch’s gallery radiate an almost weightless aura, others display a heavy, solid quality, and others again surprise the beholder with unusually imaginative cuts or their natural crystal structure. They stimulate our senses with finely engraved textures or imposing cuboidal shapes. Combined with matte gold, blackened silver or stainless steel, or spotlighted without any setting at all, they provide impressive reifications of creative freedom and individuality.

    "biography": "The first edition of Art Aurea was published nearly thirty years ago in the fall of 1985. As the magazine’s editor, I visited Prof. Hermann Jünger’s jewelry and utensils class at the Academy of Visual Arts in Munich for the first time in 1986. Jünger formatively influenced art jewelry in Germany and far beyond its borders during his tenure at the Academy from 1972 to 1990. My young colleague Paulina Tsvetanova and I returned to the goldsmith’s class at the Academy on March 10, 2015 to prepare the “Who wears my art?” art-photo happening. Three stimulating days followed, full of wonderful moments for art jewelry. Professor Otto Künzli, who had succeeded Hermann Jünger as director from 1991 to 2015 and who was recently given emeritus status, led us through the various rooms. It was a touching moment. I recalled my first visit to the Academy nearly thirty years before, as well as my conversations with the marvelous teacher and human being Hermann Jünger, to whom Galerie Wittenbrink dedicated a one-man show during Munich Jewelry Days in 2015. The central theme of our discussions three decades ago was that jewelry too can be an art form. Many of the people who recently participated in the three-day “Who wears my art?” happening likewise experienced that jewelry can indeed be art. Even those who encountered art jewelry for the first time immediately realized this fact. Many wearers understood that beyond its status as art, artistic jewelry also has another dimension all its own: it changes our silhouette, our posture and our appearance. Art jewelry challenges us, questions our preferences and our self-image, reveals our inner attitudes and awakens profound emotions. One of the participants began to weep while she was being photographed by Miriam Künzli because the piece of jewelry that she had selected and worn reminded her of the death of her partner. Jewelry almost always triggers something in the individuals whose portraits were created: it makes them thoughtful, prompt",

People from Munich and guests from around the world will have the opportunity to get their portraits captured. The goals of this photographic happening are: To present the quality and diversity of contemporary art jewelry in dialogue with artistic portrait photography; and to enable people who are interested in culture to become more familiar with contemporary art jewelry. In addition to their publication in Art Aurea, these photographs will also be used for extensive press work to attract the attention of other general-interest media – ideally while the Schmucktage exhibition is still running. The Choice of Jewelry and Its Wearers The pieces of jewelry will be selected by gallerists for art jewelry. Moreover, artists can also directly apply at Art Aurea. Each participant is invited, to win interesting wearers to have their portrait picture taken. Each piece of jewelry must be current (2014/15) and only present for the duration of the photographic work in the Akademie der Bildenden Künste – each session will approx. take 30 minutes. Among others, the participants include the priest Rainer Maria Schiessler, the politician Wolfgang Zellenhofer-Rath, the cabaret artist Michael Sailer and the pianist Masako Otha. Original prints of the photographs will be reproduced in small series of maximally five prints, which will be available for purchase by the participants, as well as by galleries, museums, collectors and aficionados.

Whitened silver, optical glass, stones and modern acrylic glass are Anton Cepka’s preferred materials. Novel spatial concepts, which are relief-like at first and later become almost sculptural, are created in the shape of brooches and pendants. His jewelry and his objects as he himself says “bear all the signs of today.

Technical airflight-like, fragile futuristic forms, and the white color of the whitened silver reflect the current, technological advancement and reference our times. The execution of the objects – the drilling, sawing, filing and cutting of the silver by hand – bears witness to a great craftsmanship that is essential to Cepka’s objects. Jewelry and object artist Anton Cepka, born in the Czechoslovakian, now Slovakian town of Šulekovo in 1936, is one of the most important jewelry artists of the 20th century and a protagonist of the so-called studio jewelry movement after the Second World War. He is now considered the doyen of Slovakian and Czech jewelry designers. Initially a student at the Bratislava School of Arts and Crafts, Anton Cepka graduated under jewelry artist Jan Nušl and sculptor Alena Nováková at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague. As early as 1964, he received the Bavarian State Award for his work at Internationale Handwerksmesse (International Crafts Fair) in Munich and on the occasion of the “Schmuckschau”. His final break-through came in 1968 with his participation in the international jewelry symposium in Jablonec nad Nisou.

Born in London and now living in the city of Todi in Umbria, Italy, this artist makes her opinions visible in her unique pieces of jewelry. Her brooches and chains in organic shapes and series are masterfully crafted. Most of them are made from finely wrought gold, with visible traces left from the hammer, and from gleaming enamel. All of them pay homage to the universal beauty which this unpretentious goldsmith so greatly appreciates. Jacqueline Ryan also fits very well into the series of exhibits that the gallerist Isabella Hund organized to coincide with the Munich Crafts Fair: each show unites classical values with the highest contemporary standards.

Center piece 12 × 10 cm, length 60 cm. The subtle humor of Tabea Reulecke’s &#8220;ensouled&#8221; world of animals and plants has impressed viewers since 2007. Her enamels masterfully combine the skills of a painter and draughtswoman with the contemporary goldsmith’s art. Born in Berlin in 1981, Reulecke studied at the Technical College in Idar-Oberstein, the Estonian Art Academy in Tallinn and the Sandberg Institute in Amsterdam. Famous international galleries carry her work, which has won many prizes. After studying in Idar-Oberstein and at Escola Massana in Barcelona, Danni Schwaag from Dülmen began a career as a freelance jewelry creator in Bremen. Born the same year as Reulecke, Danni Schwaag shares Reulecke’s fondness for bright colors, painterly gestures and enamel. But rather than letting ensouled nature predominate, Schwaag highlights geometrical elements and bold chromatic contrasts. As components in the design, this artist also includes informal segments in mother-of-pearl and dried acrylic paint that were &#8220;forgotten by the painter&#8221;.

    "biography": "Pippin Drysdale, Vessel Private Track. Prcelain. 30 × 29 cm. &nbsp; Both were born in Australia and both exhibited at Galerie Marianne Heller in Heidelberg. Although they work in different genres, Pippin Drysdale (*1943) and Helen Britton (*1966) share a common theme: remembrances of the beauty of large and small things. These two artists collaboratively present their work for the first time at this new exhibition. Pippin Drysdale’s austere, tall, perfectly wheel-turned porcelain shapes rise from minimal bases and shimmer with intense colors. She sprays multiple layers of glazes to create a velvety matte shimmer. Lush yellow, orange and red tones are shot through with slender dark lines. Like memories transformed into revolving images, the seemingly weightless vessels suggest the warmth, the spaciousness and even the seasons of the year in the barren, sun-drenched landscapes of Australia. Helen Britton, who ranks among the avant-garde in joaillerie d’auteur, reconciles apparent opposites. She creates imaginative silver settings for little found objects, which can be made of precious materials such as diamonds or non-precious substances such as plastic. Her settings give a surprising and sometimes bizarre new meaning to objects that she has freed from their original contexts. Her small sculptures blossom with the effervescent hues of peculiar flowers. Helen Britton thus rescues small things from oblivion and gives them a new life in unconventional jewelry.

    "biography": "Monique Deul wants to highlight craftsmanship. The fourth artgenève begins on January 29th. The interesting characteristic: this relatively new art fair at the foot of Mont Salève also functions as a platform for the applied arts. For the first time this year, the Taste Contemporary Craft collective, which Monique Deul founded in 2012, will have the honor of serving as the curator of an exhibition of contemporary crafts. The Taste collective unites an international group of next-generation and established designers who work in the genres of ceramics, glass, metals, textiles, and wood. Commenting on the current situation, Taste says, “We’ve become desensitized by democratization, reproduction and industrialization in all aspects of our lives.” Artistic handcraftsmanship, in Taste’s view, is both a refreshing antidote to mass production and simultaneously enables us to renew our relationship to things. The members of the collective believe that their successful exhibition in early 2014 was responsible for Taste now being given the opportunity to present a selection of its repertoire at artgenève. The objective is to organize a large exhibition with artists at least once each year. In addition, diverse thematic events are organized throughout the year to shed light on particular artists or disciplines. Among the other artifacts which Taste will display at the art fair this year are pieces by the glass artists Baldwin &amp; Guggisberg, the silversmith Wiebke Meurer, and the ceramic artists Sara Flynn, Anne Marie Laureys and Alison Britton: div\" data-cycle-allow-wrap=true data-cycle-auto-height=-1 data-cycle-carousel-offset=15 data-cycle-carousel-paged=false data-cycle-carousel-filmstrip=true data-cycle-caption=\"#gallery_686ccc9a5a431 .count\" data-cycle-caption-template=\"{{slideNum}} | {{slideCount}}\">Heat, 2012.

The exhibition Between Nature and Artifice will be providing an overview of almost forty years of creativity, nurtured by an inexhaustible curiosity about unconventional techniques and materials for creating jewelry. There are not many artists who have taken such an autonomous and open-minded approach and repeatedly created innovative and highly individualized visual universes over the course of their careers. Having grown up in South Africa, Kruger often incorporates elements of African folk art in his jewelry, but he also likes to use all sorts of objects that he finds, or that connote historical shapes and decors. Thanks to Kruger’s unusual material combinations and his reinterpretations of traditional crafting techniques, which often involve textiles, the beholder can always admire his jewelry from new and surprising perspectives. The traveling exhibition will also take place at Grassi Museum (11.12.2014–08.03.2015), at the Deutsches Goldschmiedehaus Hanau (10.07.2015–27.09.2015) and Stedelijk Museum s’Hertogenbosch (October 2015 till January 2016).

    "biography": "One could hardly imagine more dissimilar approaches to ceramic sculpture, but gallerist Marianne Heller reconciles the seemingly irreconcilable in her double exhibition Figure &amp; Abstraction, Silvia Siemes – Michael Cleff. On the one hand, we have figures sculpted by Silvia Siemes. Born in 1960 and an alumna of the Academy of Arts in Bremen, she creates seemingly faded, minimalistic, terracotta figures, contemporary effigies, lost to themselves, seated, standing, brooding, gazing at something distant and visible only to them, as though reverie had transported them beyond the contexts of their lives. Enchantingly beautiful and coolly aloof, these modern or postmodern figures of yearning seem positively classical in their sculptural conception. On the other hand, Heller showcases utterly reference-free stoneware artworks by Michael Cleff, who was born in 1961 and studied at the Art Academy in Düsseldorf. Cleff’s newest pieces for the wall have relict-like outlines: some of them confront us as angular, stepped, closed, compact bodies, others as coarse, little, floating, machine blocks covered in matte black or white engobe. Despite their apparent origin in precise planning and clear construction, closer scrutiny makes them seem somehow disconcerting. The ambiguous and enigmatic quality, which evokes thoughts of paradoxical buildings, continues into their construction method and materiality. Michael Cleff, Cyborg. Silvia Siemes, Bleiben, Warten.

    "biography": "Entitled Everything Is Inside, an exhibition at Frankfurt’s Museum of Modern Art is showcasing works by the Indian artist Subodh Gupta that have been inspired by everyday life in his home country. Portraying a society that is changing rapidly due to the economic boom in the past few decades – a process that contrasts sharply with the people’s traditional values, spirituality and religious beliefs –, he thematizes the resulting tensions in his highly original sculp- tures, paintings, videos and installations. The floor of the museum’s central hall is covered with a plethora of metal ware. A number of faucets protruding from a heap of simple cookware worn by use serve to irrigate the This Is Not a Fountain installation (2011–2013). The individual elements of this creation, which refers to a painting by Matisse, have been collected by Gupta himself. Nearby, there is a pair of golden-colored bicycles complemented by several milk cans. The title, Two Cows (2003–2008), refers to one possible connotation. The question is whether this excess of apparently mundane elements can also be inter- preted as criticizing our modern consumerism, i.e. whether Gupta’s oeuvre can also be regarded as a documentation of human egotism and megalomania. What he certainly does is staging evidence of people’s satisfying their needs. &nbsp; Text Agata Waleczek Photos MMK English translation Sabine Goodman Released in ART AUREA 4-2014",

    "biography": "The winter issue of ART AUREA marks the completion of five full years since the magazine was re-established. That’s ample reason to celebrate this happy occasion with an especially opulent edition. The theme in our focal point shows that rituals are still as important as ever and that artistic objects are the optimal “energy carriers.” Seldom has a ceramist been as authentically photographed in her atelier as has Lotte Reimers, the grande dame of German ceramic art, been portrayed by our photographer Miriam Künzli, whose remarkable photos accompany an insightful interview. The photo spread was curated by Geer Pouls of Brutto Gusto in Berlin. The illustrations are an interplay of photographic artistry, contemporary ceramic (Johannes Nagel and Morten Løbner Espersen), studio glass (Massimo Micheluzzi and Bernard Heesen) and floristic (Takayuki Tomita). The versatile culture of tea in Berlin surprises aficionados with lively traditions, ancient rites and innovative shop concepts. Read our Tea Times reportage, which leads you into three teahouses, each photographed by the wonderful Miriam Wählen. No other contemporary silversmith can rival the dedication with which Antje Dienstbir has devoted herself to theme of the spoon. Explore imaginative cutlery on the interface between art and everyday culture! Is jewelry merely an emblem of one’s personality? Or is it also something entirely different? André Gali’s interview with Reinhold Ziegler sheds light on these questions. And this Norwegian jewelry artist’s use of extraterrestrial material makes the article even more exciting. As last year, ART AUREA 4-2014 includes the entire catalogue of this year’s Grassimesse, which will take place in Leipzig from October 24 to 26. Our magazine’s latest edition also features: discussions and announcements of important exhibits, incredible prices paid at auction for classic pieces of Scandinavian furniture, book reviews, the Showroom with highlights from the following Sieeraad, Hinterlan",

    "biography": "Whatever Ata Macias tackles, he turns it into gold. Whether as a DJ, club owner or restaurateur, this bearded son of Spanish-Greek parents is successful and enjoys cult status. His Robert Johnson techno club, opened in Offenbach in 1999, is legendary. With his Café Plank and his Club Michel, he has turned Frankfurt’s main station district into a hip neighborhood. This alone would be enough to dedicate an exhibition to the Ata phenomenon. But with its Give Love Back exhibition, the MAK Frankfurt is pursuing higher goals. Portrait of Ata Macias Zu Hause ( at home ), 2014. Photo Ramon Haindl. The exhibition about Ata and friends explores the question of what the applied arts can be nowadays. The curators Eva Linhart and Mahret Kupka regard them as something that is revealed not so much by the material objects themselves, but instead by their application. So the applied arts can basically be anything, including everything that Ata has ever got involved in. Showcasing a DJ’s and club owner’s lifestyle as an exhibit in a museum? Even Ata himself needed to be convinced of this idea by the curators’ arguments in favor of this project: “Ata is somebody who, by re-combining things, creates spaces and objects and designs living environments, thereby initiating projects and processes that constitute the very nature of the applied arts.” Aha! Schmuck für Clubgänger ( jewelry for clubbers ), 2005. Cockle, cassette, bottle opener, MDMA pill. Photo Anja Jahn. What visitors will find is a wide variety of colorful objects: posters, wallets, Moroccan peppermint tea etc., created, arranged or selected by Ata himself and exhibited in the Richard Meier building. Record covers and furniture from Ata’s cafés and clubs testify to his role as a DJ and creative entrepreneur, while electronic music is playing in the background. But there are also historical drinking glasses from the museum’s collection. Ata has arranged them in juxtaposition with his own publications from his time as a publish",

    "biography": "Isabelle Enders won the €15,000 Danner Prize. Her Pfefferlinge 1–5 [Little Peppercorns 1-5] combine unconventional humor with everyday practicality. Enders studied the goldsmith’s and silversmith’s art with Prof. Ulla Mayer and Prof. Simone ten Hompel at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Nuremberg from 2006 to 2012. Established in Munich in 1920, the Danner Foundation confers the Danner Prize once every three years. The competition encourages new ideas and developments in the world of crafts. This year’s patron is Bavarian State Minister Ilse Aigner. Honorary prizes worth 12,000 euros were awarded to Alexander Blank for his Jimmy series of brooches, to Barbara Butz for a planar ceramic wall piece, to Annamaria Leiste for her Traumgekrönt [Dream-Crowned] jewelry for the neck, and to the silversmith and sculptor Rose Stach for her Heli carpet. Isabelle Enders, Pepper mills Pfefferlinge1–5 [Little Peppercorns 1-5]. Brass, silver. Circa 200 craftspeople participated in the competition in 2014. Pieces by 47 of these participants are on display in an exhibition at Schlossmuseum Aschaffenburg. Last year’s submissions proved that the boundaries between the applied arts and the fine arts are becoming increasingly permeable. “In their quest for their own styles, young craftspeople are questioning traditional ideas and using creative impulses from other areas such as design, innovative, technology or the visuals arts,” writes the Munich-based foundation. This year too, the high-carat jurors’ decisions ensure that the Danner Prize continues to set international standards. &nbsp; div\" data-cycle-allow-wrap=true data-cycle-auto-height=-1 data-cycle-carousel-offset=15 data-cycle-carousel-paged=false data-cycle-carousel-filmstrip=true data-cycle-caption=\"#gallery_686ccc9e50592 .count\" data-cycle-caption-template=\"{{slideNum}} | {{slideCount}}\">Traumgekrönt [dream-crowned].

I love it as much as I did back then, I simply enjoy it. While our daily lives are becoming increasingly virtual, working with our hands means returning to what’s real. Experiencing the materials of this world with our senses boosts our intelligence. It stimulates our attention and inspires our imagination; we have to improvise and combine. It is while snipping vegetables that we create something new, not while reading cookery books.

When one looks at what Corvaja makes from gold, one could conclude that his creations are likewise part of a higher plan because his techniques are so mature and the results are utterly unique. &#8220;Gold is my obsession,&#8221; says Giovanni Corvaja A gossamer plexus of gold (2010) or a canister of golden honeycombs (2013): nothing seems impossible for this virtuoso. But his virtuosity conceals hard work and perseverance. Corvaja is not one to lay down his tools in discouragement when progress is initially difficult and unknown paths must be traversed. Just the opposite: that’s when things really become interesting for Corvaja, who was born into a family of scientists. He devotes months or even years of research and development to his ambitious projects. It’s not unusual for him to devote over 1,000 hours of work to a single piece of jewelry. Motivated by curiosity and thoroughness, he also wants to grasp things intellectually. Whether it’s the Ancient Greeks, Dante Alighieri, Arthur Schopenhauer, C. G. Jung or the contemporary Zen Meister Thich Nhat Hanh, scarcely any interview exists in which Corvaja doesn’t quote one of the great names in the history of ideas. div\" data-cycle-allow-wrap=true data-cycle-auto-height=container data-cycle-carousel-offset=20 data-cycle-carousel-paged=false data-cycle-carousel-filmstrip=false data-cycle-caption=\"#gallery_686ccc9f0bb43 .count\" data-cycle-caption-template=\"{{slideNum}} | {{slideCount}}\" data-cycle-overlay=\"#gallery_686ccc9f0bb43 .caption\" data-cycle-overlay-template=\"{{cycleTitle}}\">The Golden Fleece, 2008. 18 kt and 22 kt gold, platinum resin.\">The Golden Fleece, 2008. 18 kt and 22 kt gold, platinum resin.\">The Golden Fleece, 2008. 18 kt and 22 kt gold, platinum resin.\"> But his f",

Andrea Röthlin&#8217;s workshop in Kerns near the Vierwaldstätter lake The town of Sarnen served not only as the locale for an exhibition, but was also the place where an ordinary, industrially manufactured product was transformed into a work of art. Röthlin carefully took the leaves of wafer-thin gold, measuring eight by eight centimeters, out of the package and placed them one after another on the steel bowl until it was covered completely. In contrast to what would have been customary, i.e. leveling out protruding bits of gold foil or those that extend beyond the object’s edges so as to create an evenly gilt surface, she deliberately left them as they were, thus making for a charming effect: the protruding “surplus” is set in motion by the slightest draft in the room and starts glittering and dancing in dreamlike splendor. “For me, it looks as if golden lava erupted from the Sachseln Mountains and has created a mountain lake whose surface is rippling in a warm breeze,” the eulogist said when he opened the exhibition in 2012. &nbsp; div\" data-cycle-allow-wrap=true data-cycle-auto-height=-1 data-cycle-carousel-offset=15 data-cycle-carousel-paged=false data-cycle-carousel-filmstrip=true data-cycle-caption=\"#gallery_686ccc9f3bcf7 .count\" data-cycle-caption-template=\"{{slideNum}} | {{slideCount}}\"> By now, the gold leaf object no longer sits on the ground as it did in the gallery, but hangs suspended in the entrance area of a metalworking company in Sarnen. “The delicate gold foil edges suffered during the duration of the exhibition and due to being transported here.

    "biography": "Artisanal production at Augarten, Vienna. Vessel from the Shortcut table service. Design Thomas Feichtner The biggest event in Thomas Feichtner’s life was not his graduation from the Universität für Künstlerische und Industrielle Gestaltung [University for Artistic and Industrial Design] in Linz 1995, but a subsequent motorcycle trip through half of Europe. The experiences he had on that journey and his direct contacts with so many people during the excursion continue to enrich his life today, recalls the designer, who hosted the author at his studio in Vienna’s 7th district, a neighborhood enlivened by the presence of many creative individuals. Born in Brazil in 1970 and brought up in Düsseldorf, Feichtner is presently professor of product design at the Muthesius Kunsthochschule [Muthesius Academy of the Arts] in Kiel. His successes are chronicled on his long list of commendations and past clients, which include renowned Viennese establishments such as the Wiener Silber Manufactur, J. &amp; L. Lobmeyr, Porzellanmanufaktur Augarten and Neue Wiener Werkstätte. Feichtner also designed items for Thonet and Carl Mertens. A Viennese Pot is the title of a teapot that he designed in 2008 for the Wiener Silber Manufactur, which manufactured the vessel in a small series. More like a constructive sculpture than an object for daily use, this artifact opposes the “form follows function” design edict, with which Feichtner disagrees: “Design isn’t solely justified by its purpose, but also expresses the joy and zest of form.” He tries to convey this passion to future designers: “If I asked a student, ‘Why did you design this object in this particular way?’ and he answered ‘Because I like it this way,’ I would be wholly satisfied with his explanation. This also applies to practical applications. “I recently had a student who insisted that he simply must cast brass. Molds were accordingly constructed and the molten brass was poured. It was our first attempt with this material, but i",

    "biography": "The designer couple in their garden. As a designer couple, Ulla and Martin Kaufmann are a special case. The specialness begins with parallelisms in their education and shared career, continues with identical stylistic concepts, and culminates in the rare unity of a collaborative oeuvre. Both were born in Hildesheim in 1941. Both underwent traditional training in the goldsmith’s and silversmith’s craft from 1958 to 1962. Both passed the master’s examination. Both are active in an exciting interdisciplinary field of craft, design and art. Asked which of them deserves credit for one innovation or another, they answer: “We do everything together.” Since 1970, they’ve collaboratively transformed a former farmstead on the outskirts of Hildesheim into a place where cuisine and art, holistic living and working can thrive amidst a vegetable garden and a fruit orchard, a residence and a workshop. To convey a visual impression of this microcosm, Achim Hatzius traveled from Berlin to Hildesheim in December 2013. He and his camera accompanied the Kaufmanns throughout a long and busy day. He shot photos on film that he had kept in a refrigerator for many years. The graininess, the seemingly tinted hues and the black-and-white images transport viewers to an epoch when many photographers swore by personal film material and frequently developed pictures in their own darkrooms. While digitization was making progressively greater inroads in the 1990s, the Kaufmanns wrought their first pieces of gold jewelry, to which they gave such unimposing names as Just Sheet Metal, Mirrored, and Nearly Nothing. div\" data-cycle-allow-wrap=true data-cycle-auto-height=-1 data-cycle-carousel-offset=15 data-cycle-carousel-paged=false data-cycle-carousel-filmstrip=true data-cycle-caption=\"#gallery_686ccca08bbc1 .count\" data-cycle-caption-template=\"{{slideNum}} | {{slideCount}}\">A former barn has been extended to a spacious workshop.Ulla und Martin Kaufmann&#8217;s minimalistic vessel objects.Bangles and",

Wegner\">AP 46 Ox Chair.\">AP 46 Ox Chair.\">AP 46 Ox Chair.\"> The principle of formal simplicity was first articulated in art, architecture and product design during the early years of modern era, but how relevant is this principle nowadays? The recently published autumn 3-2014 edition of Art Aurea focuses on this theme: The Longing for Simplicity presents artists, architects and designers whose creations combine constructive clarity and artistic quality, for example: the ceramist Emil Heger, photographed in his atelier by Achim Hatzium and accompanied by a text written by Dr. Walter Lokau; the architect Peter Zumthor, with a text by Susanne Längle; or the jewelry designer Carl Dau, photographed by Miriam Künzli. The interview with Dr. Simone Schimpf, who directs the Museum für Konkrete Kunst [Museum of Concrete Art] in Ingolstadt, explores the latest trends that have developed from this artistic style, which has already written a chapter in the history of art. On the other hand, photographs by Hans Hansen need no words at all: the appealing simplicity of Japanese objects for daily use shows that the yearning for simplicity is not an invention of the modern era, but is deeply rooted in the culture of Asia and especially Japan. Many of today’s youngest designers have likewise discovered the appeal of unpretentious simplicity: for example, the fashion designer Kristina Kehm, who was born in Kirgizia; or the Swiss designer Sara Zouaoui, who “upcycles” used glas",

While on vacation in Canada, however, this co-founder of the renowned frogdesign atelier and his young family fell in love with a three-square-kilometer property with a cabin on a lake. They bought the plot and moved out there, and a new life began for Spreng – as well as the transformation from a dropout to a jewelry designer. Spreng, born in 1949 in Schwäbisch Gmünd, owes his success to the fact that his legendary pieces, such as the Ice Cone Rings, Vulcano Brooches, or his Blub series, were more audacious, original and humorous than any other gold or platinum jewelry complemented with colored gemstones available on the market back then. div\" data-cycle-allow-wrap=true data-cycle-auto-height=-1 data-cycle-carousel-offset=15 data-cycle-carousel-paged=false data-cycle-carousel-filmstrip=true data-cycle-caption=\"#gallery_686ccca1cc4ab .count\" data-cycle-caption-template=\"{{slideNum}} | {{slideCount}}\">Likes radical artistic concepts: Georg SprengSpreng&#8217;s pieces are produced at goldsmiths&#8217; workbenchesVis-à-vis the hills of the Swabian AlbBangles of gold and platinum with colored gemstones One day, in the midst of Canada’s pristine nature, and prompted by nothing but the desire to design something, Spreng crafted a neck hoop from a piece of wood. At some point, he also dug out the two small gold bars, which he had buried under his cabin “just to be on the safe side”, and used an ordinary hammer, as well as an axe as an anvil, to forge the fine gold to form a wide neck hoop. “You’re not exactly the same person any more after you’ve put on such an unusual piece of jewelry,” Spreng remembers. Today, this archaic neck hoop serves as evidence of his fresh start, and is not for sale. Originally, Spreng believed that one can only make jewelry for oneself – or at the most for somebody one knows very well. But he was curious to know what other people woul",

In sheer ignorance of its origins, they christened this mysterious substance of inexplicable hardness, which could be scratched only by a diamond, after the Italian name of the Cowry sea snail, i.e. porcellana. After all, they believed that the brightly sounding porcelain bodies — which are all the more translucent the thinner their walls — were made of the snails’ crushed shells. div\" data-cycle-allow-wrap=true data-cycle-auto-height=-1 data-cycle-carousel-offset=15 data-cycle-carousel-paged=false data-cycle-carousel-filmstrip=true data-cycle-caption=\"#gallery_686ccca20ccc3 .count\" data-cycle-caption-template=\"{{slideNum}} | {{slideCount}}\">Jong-Min Lee combines artistic inventiveness with an intensity in terms of the crafting process that can be described only inadequately using the phrase “the discovery of slowness”.Jong Min Lee working at one of his porcelain vessels.Episode-Soar, 2013.

He has won numerous awards worldwide and been a member of the Genevan Académie Internationale de la Céramique since 1994. After many years of journeying around the globe, this ceramist extraordinaire discovered the material of his life in the atelier of the Dutch artist Barbara Nanning in 1984: porcelain, to which he has been dedicating himself exclusively ever since. Working in his own workshop in Basel since 1989, the innovative pottery extremist and obsessive tinkerer has consistently been challenging the “white gold” as a material, using downright revolutionary techniques and taking it to almost its molecular limits. Originally creating breathtaking wheel-thrown vessels from colored porcelain clay using the “new neriage” technique, he now focuses solely on pure-white, translucent and usually unglazed Limoges porcelain. Using a knife, he shaves the already ultra-thin walls of large bowls down to the thinness of a membrane, or he uses a gas torch to work on footless, parabola-shaped cast vessels, blasting off fragments and thus perforating their walls, as well as reducing their thickness to mere fractions of a millimeter. The results are surreally translucent bowl objects of radiant beauty, which Arnold Annen also presents in groups as lighting installations.
